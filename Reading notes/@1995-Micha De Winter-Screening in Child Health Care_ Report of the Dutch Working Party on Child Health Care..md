#### “Introduction a critical evaluation of Dutch preventive Child Health Care” ([De Winter, 1995, p. ix](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=10&annotation=Z44DWI4P))

> “To put it briefly: Dutch Child Health Care, which for a long time had enjoyed wide social support and appreciation, found itself faced with the obligation to legitimize itself under the influence of new political developments; society demanded a more accurate insight into the results of its efforts. Within this context, the project called 'Integral Evaluation of Child Health Care' was initiated. The Board of the National Association for Community Nursing and Home Carel commissioned the Centre for Research and Development of Youth Health Care and Youth Social Work of the University of Utrecht to subject the Dutch Child Health Care system to a scientific study.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. ix](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=10&annotation=DBDA5SUB))

> “On the basis of the literature studies, consensus meetings were held concerning the following subjects: the objectives of the Child Health Care system, immunizations, phenylketonuria (PKU) and congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) screenings, hearing examinations, visual examinations, language/speech examinations, periodic medical examinations, prevention of psychosocial and educational problems, health education, activities aimed at influencing social and physical environmental factors, and, finally, the quality and the organization of the Child Health Care system.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. xi](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=12&annotation=Y75ZCIJH))

> “The Integral Evaluation Project was an effort to provide the best possible survey of the effectiveness and quality of the Dutch Child Health Care system.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. xi](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=12&annotation=GWHCZI9V))

> “The most remarkable conclusion of the project is that the Dutch Child Health Care system maybe considered a very solid kind of organized programmed prevention. The system owes its strength to its thorough national organization, and its firm establishment at community and district levels. The great trust this form of preventive care enjoys with the public is an essential precondition for an invariably high population coverage, which in its turn is responsible for the high degree of health benefit that is obtained with the system.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. xi](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=12&annotation=D6BT7D46))

#### “1.1 Aims of pre-school Child Health Care” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=15&annotation=FP9RHRRN))

> “What then, exactly, are the aims and functions of pre-school Child Health Care? To begin with these do not, of course, constitute a static whole. At the time the first Child Health Clinics were established, some 100 years ago, the health of children was far worse than it is now. Because of poverty, ignorance of essential hygiene and lack of facilities, rampant infectious diseases and so on, infant mortality was very high (25% on average). Obviously, the main objective of 'Child Health Care' then was to fight such evils. The means used included social action, collective and individual education of mothers, the distribution of good quality milk and the opening of Child Health Clinics. As mortality and morbidity (from infectious diseases) decreased, the objectives of Child Health Care shifted. Gradually child development and 'mental hygiene' came into view as objects of care.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=15&annotation=PK56RPGQ)) This clearly explains the aims as expanding from body to system

> “The main aim of pre-school Child Health Care, as expressed in 1972 by the Netherlands League of Maternity Care and Child Health Hygiene (Nederlandse Bond van Moederschapszorg en Kinderhygiene) was 'the promotion and safeguarding of the health, growth and development of young people'.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=15&annotation=6PSM2R8A))

> “In 1985 the Dutch Association of Child Health Care ([[Nederlandse vereniging voor jeugdgezondheidszorg]]) widened the aim: 'Child Health Care, within the welfare and health care system, aims to provide the longitudinal socia-medical guidance that will enable each individual, as a young person and as an adult, to function at his/her best individually and in a social context'.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=15&annotation=RD9Z9S8E))

> “In the last few years, finally, a case has been argued for making more room within the system of care for the parents' responsibility for and contribution to the health and development of their children, as well as for considering the living environment of the child and its parents an object of Child Health Care. 1” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=15&annotation=8258E96J))

> “From this perspective the aim of pre-school Child Health Care can now be defined as follows: 'The promotion and safeguarding of a healthy physical, mental and social development of the population of pre-school children, starting from the parents' personal responsibility, by means of influencing the relevant health determinants, namely physical factors, health behaviour and relevant environmental factors, including the system of care itself'.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=16&annotation=XEKY4R54)) <p> Would make a case that as a result of its success, its scope became broader - not smaller, as is often suggested

> “It is the objective of pre-school Child Health Care to improve immunity against infectious diseases.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=16&annotation=NLE8SNDU))

> “It is the objective of pre-school Child Health Care to detect the threat of individual health risks and disorders in time and, if necessary, refer.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=16&annotation=74M6Q4MN))

> “It is the objective of pre-school Child Health Care to promote, at an individual and collective level, the personal competence and the responsibility of parents with regard to their children, if necessary by advancing their understanding of the health condition and (potential) development of their child and by increasing their competence (health promoting behaviour).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=16&annotation=N92PK9BV))

> “It is the objective of pre-school Child Health Care to provide insight into the health condition of (groups of) young people, to point out social risk factors that threaten health and to contribute to the elimination of such factors.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=16&annotation=QN5S9G3I))

#### “1.2 Procedures in pre-school Child Health Care” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=16&annotation=22WEAQNC))

> “One important reason for this is that the methods at the service of pre-school Child Health Care are not at all of equal order. On the one hand, for instance there are specific, unambiguous interventions such as immunizations and screenings that serve a well defined health target; on the other hand there are activities with a much wider scope, such as counselling or giving advice and information on the development of children and so on. Finally the presence, accessibility and social roots of the system of care are major preconditions themselves.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=17&annotation=NU2GRQIQ))

> “An adequate organization of the system itself, in other words, is a necessary condition for the effectiveness of the whole of pre-school Child Health Care.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=17&annotation=4QSQPJNI))

> “Therefore, if we are to chart pre-school Child Health Care, two levels should be distinguished. The first level is the provision of the required conditions: the organized system of care, the extensive network of clinics for babies and young children, from which numerous preventive and health promotion activities are developed.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=17&annotation=ARJSQY9I))

> “The second level consists of the specific medical, nursing and educational methods for prevention and intervention, including immunization, screenings, counselling and the drawing up of health profiles.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=17&annotation=5VVWSYSZ))

#### “1.2.1 The organized system of care” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=17&annotation=LYVA5FQS))

> “For decades, pre-school preventive health care in the Netherlands has been carried out by the 'Cross' organizations.2 Amsterdam, where this care is provided by the Municipal Health Service, is an exception to the rule.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=17&annotation=G6KMJ6PT))

> “2For a long time 'Cross Associations' (Kruisverenigingen) have been active in the Netherlands in the fields of social and preventive medicine and home nursing on behalf of their members as well as of the general public. The National Cross Association (National Kruisvereniging) represented the regional cross associations at national level. In 1990 the National Cross Association merged with the National Council for Home Help (Centrale Raad voor de [[Gezinsverzorging]]) to form the National Association for Community Nursing and Home Care (Landelijke Vereniging voor Thuiszorg), established at Bunnik. In this book the regional organizations will be referred to as 'Community Health Care'.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=17&annotation=34M2MIY7)) Notion of "community health care is effective"

> “school Child Health Care takes place in a number of different ways: in Child Health Clinics, in home visits, group education and 'external' activities including participation in working groups on Early Detection and in neighbourhood networks for youth welfare work.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=18&annotation=MV46WFE6))

> “In the course of years, a very close national network for pre-school Child Health Care has been built up through local organizations. Both the population and the authorities consider the clinics and the connected activities as a basic facility; practically every parent in the Netherlands made and makes regular use of them.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=18&annotation=M7ZSX3SM))

> “The basic character of this facility can also be seen from the way it is financed: pre-school Child Health Care is largely paid for under the Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (Algemene Wet op de Bijzondere Ziektekosten AWBZ), which makes this form of care accessible to everyone and thus provides a nationwide guaranteed basic package.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=18&annotation=KRUXZP39))

> “The baby clinics have a stable coverage of over 95%, the clinics for preschool children some 85%. PKU/CHT screening covers 99.6%, the immunization level is more than 93% (Drewes 1989), and the range of hearing screening by the Ewing method is 86% (NSDSK 1989)3. No percentages are known of the number of home visits made annually by district nurses, but they are estimated at one million per year (Bos & De Winter 1989). International comparison shows that, certainly as far as immunizations, PKU/CHT screening and hearing screening are concerned, these figures are among the highest in the world. Partly for these reasons, the Netherlands has the lowest child mortality among the under-fives in the world after Japan, Sweden and Finland.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=18&annotation=XM9WULV8))

> “Another important criterion for assessing the Dutch system of Child Health Care is the quality of the system and its reaction speed. Health and health care are not static. The health situation of the population in care changes, old threats lessen and new risks may present themselves. Scientific opinions change, making new forms of intervention possible. For this reason the system of care should possess some degree of flexibility and the ability to meet new challenges with new methods. In the past few years the effectiveness of a soundly organized and flexibly operating pre-school Child Health Care has been demonstrated several times. One example of this is the introduction of a new vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) a few years ago, which, within a year of its introduction, achieved the same high degree of immunization of over 90% as the long established” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=18&annotation=D5UT9C9S)) This is exteremely fascinating - because it shows that scientific findings were indeed rapidly disseminated to the population through the network of consultation offices.

> “immunizations of the National Immunization Programme (Rijksvaccinatie Programma RVp)4. Another example concerns health education: by changing the advice about laying babies on their stomachs a quick and sharp decrease in the incidence of cot death was brought about (De Jonge 1992).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=19&annotation=RTCIXB3R))

> “Finally, in a recent recommendation, the National Health Council (Nationale Raad voor de Volksgezondheid NRV) focused attention on the notion of 'programmed prevention,.5 Programmed prevention is described as: 'systematically executed preventive activities carried out according to a fixed division of tasks and procedure and aimed at a defined target group, the coverage of the target group being monitored' (Van de Water & Davidse 1992)” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=19&annotation=32AL6PQ2)) This is interesting and not yet on the radar. From the 1990s, the preventive child health care was organised through a project base.

> “sThis NRV recommendation is partly based on a preliminary report called Organizational strengthening of prevention in primary care (Organisatiorische versterking van preventie in de eerstelijnszorg), published by NIPG/TNO, Leiden (Van de Water & Davidse 1992).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=19&annotation=PRBIIPFH))

> “Pre-school Child Health Care in its entirety may be described as a mainly individually targeted form of organized programmed prevention. Collectively, targeted programmed prevention mainly takes place outside the sector's field of responsibility.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=20&annotation=KF2KZCSS)) So in the 1990, preventive child health care is understood as individually oriented

> “In this report the latter category will be referred to as 'prevention to measure' (or individually geared 'prevention'). Examples of standardized prevention programmes are: the National Immunization Programme; PKU and CHT screening; hearing screening; checks for visual disorders; developmental surveillance; detection of language and speech disorders; as well as some types of health education (for instance Accident Prevention Cards)6.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=20&annotation=YUJT26RR))

#### “1.3 Outcome measurement” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=23&annotation=PZPRGRAR))

> “In the course of the project however, the conclusion was reached that a specific set of instruments should be developed for a permanent and comprehensive insight into the cost-effectiveness ratios within pre-school Child Health Care. The Institute for Social Health Care (Instituut voor Maatschappelijke Gezondheidszorg) of the Erasmus University of Rotterdam was commissioned to undertake this. In the research project the outcomes and costs of screening methods will be reviewed first, based on the following broad definition of the concept of screening: 'when (at fixed times and according to a fixed protocol) parents are asked questions and observations are being carried out on children to ascertain whether a number of defined health disorders (a) are probably present or threaten to arise and/or (b) further diagnosis and/or therapy is needed, it may be said that screening takes place for this series of defined disorders' (Van der Maas 1991).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=24&annotation=M78UAAFW))

> “According to Van der Maas, the outcomes of screening fall into two main groups: bringing forward diagnosis and the health benefits achieved by this.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=24&annotation=PG947FAP))

#### “2 Immunizations” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=28&annotation=HWNHII5P))

> “Internationally, the Netherlands has a name for its excellent prevention of infectious diseases, resulting from a very high immunization uptake. Since 1979, the national average for all immunizations has been more than 90% (GHI 1981a, 1991a, 1992). This has been accomplished thanks to excellent computerized administration, to a great willingness (virtually 100%) on the part of the public to make use of the National Immunization Programme (RVP) 1, to a well-developed and easily accessible network of Child Health Clinics and the Child Health Care Departments of the District and Municipal Health Services (GGD).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=28&annotation=2BWGDT4Z))

#### “2.1 The National Immunization Programme (RVP)” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=28&annotation=ZEY45QH6))

> “ach year, the Minister for Welfare, Public Health and Cultural Affairs (WVC) lays down the R VP for that year on the recommendations of the National Health Council (N ationaleRaad voor de Volksgezondheid NRV),” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=28&annotation=VSEFRILN))

> “Each year the Inspectorate publishes a leaflet setting out the immunization programme for that year, and distributes this among the officials responsible for implementation.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=29&annotation=NKGTD5JI))

> “The immunizations of the R VP have not always been the same: adjustments are made from time to time as a result of new epidemiological insights and technical possibilities.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=29&annotation=2NDLG66G))

> “The initial impetus for the R VP was the [[polio]] epidemic in 1956 which claimed 2206 victims. A diphtheria-pertussis-[[tetanus]] vaccine (DPT) had been available in the Netherlands since 1952, and was extensively used in the child health clinics, so that 70% of the children had been immunized with DPT by the time (1957) the RVP was introduced (Hannik 1963).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=29&annotation=GCU78BMC))

> “At an even earlier stage, children in the Netherlands were being immunized against [[smallpox]] and diphtheria. With the introduction of the RVP in 1957, inactivated triple [[polio]] vaccine (Salk vaccine) was used, initially as a separate [[[[Polio]]|[[Pol]]io|[[pol]]io]] vaccine and from 1962 onwards as a combined diphtheriatetanus-pertussis-[[polio]] vaccine.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=29&annotation=NQZVTWX2))

> “The use of the Salk vaccine makes the Netherlands fairly exceptional because in most other countries live oral [[polio]] vaccine (Sabin vaccine) is used.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=29&annotation=KHQ8R5X4))

> “In 1974, the immunization of ll-year-old girls against rubella (German measles) was started as a separate immunization, followed by a separate immunization against measles in 1976. In 1987, both disappeared again from the RVP with the introduction of the combined immunization against mumps, measles and rubella (MMR).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=29&annotation=XGWLH8GX))

> “On 1 April 1993, the immunization against Haemophilus Influenzae type b was added to the RVP.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=29&annotation=B76LI9WB))

> “However, before any further additions are made, it must be quite clear that the practicability of the programme will not be jeopardized, and that the motivation of parents and professionals will not diminish as a result (Bijkerk 1986a).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=30&annotation=MVLZCXMD))

> “The RVP is implemented by the two Child Health Care systems in the Netherlands. The first are the Community Health Care Organizations, which are responsible for preventive health care services for pre-school children. From the moment children go to school, preventive health care is carried out by the departments of Child Health Care of the District and Municipal Health Authorities (GGD). These authorities also conduct campaigns for schoolchildren who, for some reason or other, have been incompletely, or not at all, immunized. Implementation of the R VP is the responsibility of the Provincial Immunization Administration (ProvinciaIe Entadministratie PEA).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=30&annotation=L4V9D7S2))

> “The administrative organization has been assigned to the Provincial Immunization Adminstration PEA (Ministry of Public Health and Environmental Protection 1974a,b). The provinces of Overijssel and Flevoland share one PEA, the other 10 provinces have a PEA of their own, as do the cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, so that there are 13 PEAs in the country. In addition to the administrative organization of the R VP, the PEAs have also been charged with the administration of the screening programmes for phenylketonuria (PKU), congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) and of the combined screening and immunization programme for hepatitis B.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=31&annotation=3IKFCGW9))

> “The vaccines for the R VP are procured by the PEAs from, or via, the RIVM. The PEAs take care of the distribution to the Child Health Clinics and the District and Municipal Health Services where the immunizations are gIven.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=31&annotation=CXUHEWR6))

> “For the benefit of those responsible for implementation, details of the RVP are set out in guidelines, which were originally published by the Medical Inspectorate (GHI 1981b). Because these guidelines had never been updated, most child health clinics used a publication of the Overijssel and Flevoland PEA with practical guidelines and background information (Burgmeijer & Bolscher 1990). Recently, the information was updated and published in book form, together with useful information about other immunizations frequently given to children (Burgmeijer & Bolscher 1993).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=31&annotation=83X4RT4X))

The effectiveness is demonstrated by the fact that, after the introduction of immunizations against diphtheria, [[whooping cough]], [[tetanus]], [[polio]], measles and rubella, the incidence rates went down to the present, extremely low, levels. Even though, as a result of improvements in conditions of social hygiene and the availability of sophisticated diagnostic procedures and therapeutics, the drop in mortality and morbidity rates had already started before immunization was introduced.

Late discovery ofhearing impairment may result in a disruption of development. At Child Health Clinics the hearing functions of young children have always been checked, but from the 1960s onward this has takenplace systematically on all children by means of a standardized screening method: the Ewing test (Ewing & Ewing 1944). The aim of this method is to detect all hearing impairments at the age of about 9 months. In this chapter, normal hearing is briefly discussed, then the various types of impairment. Subsequently, attention is given to the problem of secretory otitis media (SOM) and its detection, the objective and function of screening and the methodsof measuring whether or not the objectivehas been or is being attained.

Vision defects that are unidentified or are identified too late may lead to (irreparable) impairment of vision, which can cause delayed and/or disturbed general development. Until a few years ago, there was no systematic method for the detection of visual defects that was workable in the clinic. Even though the Van Wiechen check-lise includes a number of items aimed at the assessment of the visual faculty, there was a clear need for standardization of research, evaluation of results, uniformity and promotion of quality and expertise in this field (Lantau 1989).

In the case of defects which are not or are hardly treatable, detection is worthwhile because of the genetic implications and the guidance of parent and child.

Although insight into the causes and the course of developmental disorders is still limited, there is consensus that development and therefore developmental impairment can be multi-causally determined. Expressed in the terminology of the ecological health model described in Chapter 1, causes of developmental impairment can be found in physical factors or their interaction (endogenous causes), and in both behavioural factors (child's or parents' lifestyle) and socio-physical environment.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 96](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=109&annotation=EU4N5SUB))

A gross motor impairment, for instance, can be due to a physical factor (e.g. a muscle disease), to a behavioural factor (e.g. too little stimulation from parents), or to a factor in the socio-physical environment (e.g. not enough play opportunities at home and/or in the neighbourhood).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 96](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=109&annotation=RZ78LIZ7)) Interesting how the care systems seems to have agency

> “Clearly the great number of theoretical concepts lead to just as many descriptions or definitions of the concept developmental impairment. In the biological model, a developmental impairment is seen to be caused by constitutional abnormalities or disorders. In the environmental model, negative environmental influences are blamed; in the interactive model both factors may be considered to give rise to impairment. Finally, in the transactional view, developmental impairments are seen to be the result of unfavourably proceeding transactions (interactions) between child and environment, whereby the child gets insufficient or no chance to adapt to its world, and then to (re)organize and to (re)structure its world. It is assumed in this view that man possesses a 'self-regulating power' (Sameroff 1975). The breadth of the concept of development, as outlined above, constitutes an extra complication when describing the concept of developmental impairment, particularly in the framework of a transactional model.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=110&annotation=UPE5B2ET))

Thus the child's situation at the time that its development is screened must not differ too much from the situation in which what is considered "normal" was determined.

In the Netherlands, for example, the term periodic medical examination has come to refer to the longitudinal follow-up and assessment of the growth and development of the young child including, of course, history taking and the giving of advice as needed. Depending on the definition that is chosen, the periodic medical examination is taken to mean either the regular physical examination alone, or a combination of the physical examination, screenings, developmental assessment, educational prevention activities and counselling, health education, and sometimes also immunization.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 126](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=139&annotation=4CHJU24I))

In various domains in the field of health and development, specific research methods, often standardized, have been developed which now operate more or less independently within the structure of the clinics. In chronological order, the most striking examples of these are the hearing test (Ewing method), developmental assessment (Van Wiechen check-list3), examination of the eyes (Early Detection vision) and the language/speech test (Early Detection language).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 127](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=140&annotation=8Q3VYQJ3))

It wrongly suggests a kind of methodological and disciplinary uniformity, while the practical situation that has developed is actually one of diversity. However, because the concept of periodic medical examination has been generally adopted by professionals, there have been many attempts to give the old term a new meaning. An unwelcome result of this is that quite a few, often contradictory, definitions of periodic medical examination are used, varying from very narrow definitions (the aggregate of scientifically recognized screening methods), to very broad definitions (the integral assessment and promotion of health and welfare).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 128](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=141&annotation=PQAF39QA))

The integral promotion and assessment of the health and welfare of the child and its parents includes history taking, physical and psychosocial examination, the drawing up of a health profile, health education, and counselling.

He describes the latter component as 'the vigilant supervision of all aspects of the health and wellbeing of children whenever they come into contact with health care professionals'. It is concerned with 'seeing whether anything is wrong' rather than with 'looking for a particular condition'. However, with respect to this surveillance component, Butler draws attention to an important evaluation problem: whatever the importance of this form of 'many-faceted diagnostic awareness' might be, it is virtually impossible to quantify or measure. 'How much of this kind of oversight is done, by whom, at what cost, and to what effect, are questions upon which the literature can throw almost no light' (Butler 1989).” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 130](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=143&annotation=68CXAZLY))

The lack of insight into the reliability of parent information probably has a lot to do with this.

While, in the United Kingdom, parents can consult a doctor when they are concerned about their child, the system in the Netherlands is such that there are frequent contacts with the parents to prevent a situation developing in which parents become worried about the health and/or development of their child.” ([De Winter, 1995, p. 144](zotero://select/library/items/9J8ISY6J)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZVU64JR?page=157&annotation=G7MTYB8J))

The fact that a new form of organization and content has been realized in a number of districts in the United Kingdom, now makes empirical comparison of the two systems possible. Of course, the first question to ask is: to what extent are the two systems comparable, considering the different organizational and epidemiological contexts of the Dutch and British health care systems? A second question is whether the differences are as great in practice as the ideal programmes would suggest. One might, for example, assume that the total number of visits that parents pay to consultatiebureaus or Child Health Clinics does not differ very much: parents who are seldom called up may well make frequent use of open clinics. In view of the fact that there is practically no data on outcomes available for either of the s~stems, it would seem evident that a study should be done on this aspect 7.

At visits to the clinic, psychosocial development and upbringing are recurring themes. These matters are often discussed during examinations, for instance that with the Van Wiechen check-listl or the periodic health examination. Sometimes parents ask explicit questions, or they indicate implicitly that they are worried or have problems.

> “A more or less concurring plea comes from Merkx (1992) and concerns a Personal Health Record for Child Health Care from birth to 19 years (analogous to the personal health records already developed in France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom); the main characteristic of such a record is that it is held by the parents.

As to the first objection, Merkx states that the experience with the Growth Book is that the percentage of lost copies is low. Hopman and Vroonhof (1992) arrive at the same result: the 183 parents polled by them kept the Growth Book carefully. With regard to the second objection, Merkx poses that openness on sensitive subjects (for instance suspected child abuse) may assist early detection.
