This information is based on [[Lieburg - 2001 - Een Eeuw Thuiszorg in Rotterdam, 1901-2001]] (pp155-165):

'Initially' (?), a consultation office consisted out of the following rooms:
- [[spreekkamer]]
- [[boxenkamer]]
- [[Wachtkamer]]

[[Troughtout the 20th century, whereas care at consultation offices was initially focussed on growth and nutrition, focus shifted towards early recognition of developmental deficits. ]] this is ultimately tied with [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]].

- [[Ewing-gehooronderzoek]]  in the 1990s and later the [[Capas-test]] in 1996

This succeeded the [[blauwe boekje]].
