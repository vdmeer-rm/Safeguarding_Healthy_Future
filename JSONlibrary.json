      "abstractNote": "The emerging fields of social epidemiology and population health seek to understand the social determinants of health. Especially, with regards to how income inequality causes health disparities, attention has been focused on material and psychosocial mechanisms. I use examples from the epidemiological and social science literature to argue for a third broad etiological framework: the role played by the ways we generally recognize, define, name, and categorize disease states and attribute them to a cause or set of causes. These framing effects shape population health by influencing: health and illness beliefs; patterns of consumption and other behaviors; perceptions of what interventions and policies work; class, ethnic, and other social dynamics; and clinical and public health practices. Important characteristics of many framing phenomena are their capacity to be self-perpetuating and their performative power. A better understanding of framing effects can lead to deploying them more deliberatively and flexibly to improve individual and population health.",

Unlike the situation in many other health conditions and despite the evident inequalities in access to e and quality of e health care, African Americans with hypertension are more likely to be correctly diagnosed and treated than European Americans (there remain, nevertheless, significant and disturbing disparities in the underlying incidence of hypertension, due in part to differences in diet and activity and their multiple determinants, as well as in hypertension control; Hertz, Unger, Cornell, &amp; Saunders, 2005). One possible explanation for the ‘‘positive’’ pattern is that earlier public health educational campaigns aimed at the African American community and physicians worked and became self-perpetuating as both medical and lay beliefs about who was at risk changed.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F24ELAB2T%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Aronowitz, 2008, p. 8</span>)</span> Haha - positive still in between quotation marks.

This situation has brought change to libraries and has challenged librarians to find new solutions to old problems. But there is little consensus as to what needs to be changed nor is there a broad-based method for assessing and analyzing t e conditions in order to reach agreement. The practice of entrepreneurship as espoused by Peter Drucker is examined for its application to the current crisis and as a methodology for change.",

      "abstractNote": "The launch of a revolutionary new scientific theory represents a rare occasion on which the apparently cumulative development of science might be influenced by particular events. Yet in the case of the Darwinian revolution it is often claimed that the theory of evolution by natural selection would have emerged more or less inevitably, given the scientific and cultural circumstances prevailing in mid-Victorian Britain. This essay challenges that claim by arguing that if Darwin had not been there to write his Origin of Species the subsequent development of biology would have occurred along a line that steadily diverged from the sequence of events we actually experienced. There would certainly have been an evolutionary movement in the late nineteenth century, but there would have been no selection theory to disturb the progressionist assumptions of the time. A totally non-Darwinian evolutionism might not have generated the challenges that led to the emergence of modern genetics in the early twentieth century, resulting in a very different understanding of the relationship between development, heredity, and environment.",

      "abstractNote": "This briefing paper aims to provide a historical perspective that can inform the debates about what the future of academic publishing should look like. We argue that current policy regarding open access publishing, and many of the other proposals for the reform of academic publishing, have been too focused on the opportunities and financial challenges of the most recent changes in digital communications technologies and have given undue weight to commercial concerns. We show that the business practices and the cultural significance of academic publishing have been significantly transformed since the late nineteenth century as increasing government funding drove the expansion and professionalization of the research community, a process that accelerated rapidly after the Second World War. We examine how academic publishing practices have responded to the increasing number of researchers and publications worldwide, the changing expectations of academic workloads and outputs in the higher education sector, and the new business models in the publishing industry. A key phenomenon has been the growing importance of published works as career-defining tokens of prestige for academics. Although the new technologies that emerged in the late twentieth century offer great potential for improving the speed and efficiency of scholarly communication, the publishing model has been relatively slow to change.",

      "abstractNote": "A review of Garfield’s journal impact factor and its specific implementation as the Thomson Reuters impact factor reveals several weaknesses in this commonly-used indicator of journal standing. Key limitations include the mismatch between citing and cited documents, the deceptive display of three decimals that belies the real precision, and the absence of confidence intervals. These are minor issues that are easily amended and should be corrected, but more substantive improvements are needed. There are indications that the scientific community seeks and needs better certification of journal procedures to improve the quality of published science. Comprehensive certification of editorial and review procedures could help ensure adequate procedures to detect duplicate and fraudulent submissions.",

      "abstractNote": "The multibillion-dollar fertility industry promotes standardization in in vitro fertilization laboratories. Transnational pharmaceutical and biotechnological giants distribute a wide range of fertility products, from embryo culture mediums and incubator technologies to add-ons such as time-lapse embryo monitoring. These technologies are designed to standardize and automate knowledge production regarding embryonic viability. More effective knowledge production enables the more effective selection of embryos for transfer, which in turn leads to more future babies and enables economic scaling-up. Drawing on two multi-sited ethnographic studies at eight fertility clinics in Finland during 2013–2020, this article discusses how knowledge about embryos is produced in the processes and practices of embryo culture. We argue that automation and standardization in clinical practice are not always perceived as economically desirable. Sometimes standard technologies do not replace hands-on knowledge production, although they may transform it. The technologies are also perceived as modifying the object of knowledge itself in undesired or unnecessary ways. In such cases, concerns are raised regarding the best interests of patients, embryos and future babies, who might be better served by masterful laboratory craftwork. We conclude that embryo culture is not only a site of knowledge production – one that aims to make babies and parents through standard and craftwork knowledge practices – but also a site of multiple bio-economies of assisted reproduction, some of which resist automation and standardization.",

The contributions to this volume demonstrate that RES have the potential to intrude deeply into the conditions, social relationships and practices of knowledge production. Some RES influence a crucial condition of knowledge production, namely the access to resources. Some of them also change relations within scientific communities by both opening up and demanding new ways of participation by academics in science policy making, thereby shifting the balance of power between those who evaluate and those who are evaluated.",

This situation has brought change to libraries and has challenged librarians to find new solutions to old problems. But there is little consensus as to what needs to be changed nor is there a broad-based method for assessing and analyzing t e conditions in order to reach agreement. The practice of entrepreneurship as espoused by Peter Drucker is examined for its application to the current crisis and as a methodology for change.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper was presented at a conference on 'The Social Impact of Modern Biology', organized by the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science in London, 26-28 November 1970. It will appear in the volume of conference proceedings edited by Watson Fuller—to be published on 21 May 1971 by Routledge & Kegan Paul as The Impact of Modern Biology (hard cover £1.75, paperback £0.50)—and is reprinted by kind permission. Because of the interest it aroused at the time, and the way in which it drew on material from several academic disciplines, we are taking the unusual step of reproducing the paper here so that readers may have the advantage of the extended bibliographical and discursive footnotes, which will not be included in the conference proceedings., The paper was designed basically for an audience of scientists who were assumed to have no knowledge of recent literature on social and historical aspects of science. Dr Young is himself active within the history and philosophy of science, and is working towards a closer relationship with relevant studies in sociology and social anthropology. He makes no claim to a comprehensive knowledge of all the related background literature, nor to having provided here an exhaustive bibliography. This paper is in the nature of a report of work and thought in progress, and a provisional sketch of an emerging point of view. Discussion, criticism and elaboration of the paper's contents, in the form of Notes or Letters, will be welcomed.",

      "abstractNote": "We report on an exploratory study consisting of brief case studies in selected disciplines, examining what motivates researchers to work (or want to work) in an open manner with regard to their data, results and protocols, and whether advantages are delivered by working in this way. We review the policy background to open science, and literature on the benefits attributed to open data, considering how these relate to curation and to questions of who participates in science. The case studies investigate the perceived benefits to researchers, research institutions and funding bodies of utilising open scientific methods, the disincentives and barriers, and the degree to which there is evidence to support these perceptions. Six case study groups were selected in astronomy, bioinformatics, chemistry, epidemiology, language technology and neuroimaging. The studies identify relevant examples and issues through qualitative analysis of interview transcripts. We provide a typology of degrees of open working across the research lifecycle, and conclude that better support for open working, through guidelines to assist research groups in identifying the value and costs of working more openly, and further research to assess the risks, incentives and shifts in responsibility entailed by opening up the research process are needed.",

      "abstractNote": "Purpose This article explores the recent turn within academic publishing towards ‘seamless access’, an approach to content provision that ensures users do not have to continually authenticate in order to access journal content. Design/methodology/approach Through a critical exploration of Get Full Text Research, a service developed collaboratively by five of the world's largest academic publishers to provide such seamless access to academic research, the article shows how publishers are seeking to control the ways in which readers access publications in order to trace, control and ultimately monetise user interactions on their platforms. Findings Theorised as a process of individuation through infrastructure, the article reveals how publishers are attempting an ontological shift to position the individual, quantifiable researcher, rather than the published content, at the centre of the scholarly communication universe. Originality/value The implications of the shift towards individuation are revealed as part of a broader trend in scholarly communication infrastructure towards data extraction, mirroring a trend within digital capitalism more generally.",

      "abstractNote": "This article traces the emergence of the term welfare state in British political discourse and describes competing efforts to define its meaning. It presents a genealogy of the concept's emergence and its subsequent integration into various political scripts, tracing the struggles that sought to name, define, and narrate what welfare state would be taken to mean. It shows that the concept emerged only after the core programmes to which it referred had already been enacted into law and that the referents and meaning of the concept were never generally agreed upon – not even at the moment of its formation in the late 1940s. During the 1950s, the welfare state concept was being framed in three distinct senses: (a) the welfare state as a set of social security programmes; (b) the welfare state as a socio-economic system; and (c) the welfare state as a new kind of state. Each of these usages was deployed by opposing political actors – though with different scope, meaning, value, and implication. The article argues that the welfare state concept did not operate as a representation reflecting a separate, already-constituted reality. Rather, the use of the concept in the political and economic arguments of the period – and in later disputes about the nature of the Labour government's post-war achievements – was always thoroughly rhetorical and constitutive, its users aiming to shape the transformations and outcomes that they claimed merely to describe.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper discusses the rise and fall of the theory of paternal transmission, drawing attention to the hitherto underresearched debates about the importance and impact of male-mediated harm to the embryo in reproduction that peaked around the turn of the twentieth century. The focus is on the implications of the twin \"great social evils,\" syphilis and alcohol, which converged at the time of a general transformation of medicine into experimental science and a concomitant rise in new concepts of heredity. Looking at the way in which the issue of time added to profound changes which were linked to particular visions of society and changes in the politics of gender at the turn of the century, I examine the asymmetrical relationship of sociopolitical and epistemological dimensions of time and reproduction. The paper shows how these debates were positioned within the wider context of eugenics and in relation to concepts of male reproduction that involved fundamental political, social and moral dimensions.",

The article brings into sharper focus the distinctive amalgam of ideology, research, and practice activities at the core of the Children's Bureau prevention paradigm, and presents evidence for the effectiveness of this approach in preventing infant mortality. In conclusion, the implications of this contribution and its legacy are discussed in relation to the shape and direction of social work's investments in contemporary prevention science.",

He portrays a new generation of American scientists whose pioneering work led to the bitterly debated heredity-environment controversy in the 1920s and then, in the '30s, to a \"synthetic\" theory of how heredity and environment together shaped human nature and culture. The resolution of this issue seemed to hold an exhilarating promise. If scientists could explain—and even predict—human behavior, they might help restore social control and stability in an age of domestic ferment and international turmoil.

      "abstractNote": "Between the 1930s and the mid 1970s, it was commonly believed that in 1880 Karl Marx had proposed to dedicate to Charles Darwin a volume or translation of Capital but that Darwin had refused. The detail was often interpreted by scholars as having larger significance for the question of the relationship between Darwinian evolutionary biology and Marxist political economy. In 1973–4, two scholars working independently—Lewis Feuer, professor of sociology at Toronto, and Margaret Fay, a graduate student at Berkeley—determined simultaneously that the traditional story of the proposed dedication was untrue, being based on a long-standing misinterpretation of the relevant correspondence. Between the two, and among several other scholars who became their respective allies, there developed a contest of authority and priority over the discovery. From 1975 to 1982, the controversy generated a considerable volume of spilled ink in both scholarly and popular publications. Drawing on previously unexamined archival resources, this article revisits the ‘case’ of the so-called ‘Darwin–Marx correspondence’ as an instance of the phenomenon of ‘multiple discovery’. A familiar occurrence in the natural sciences, multiple discovery is rarer in the humanities and social sciences. The present case of a priority dispute in the history of ideas followed patterns familiar from such disputes in the natural sciences, while also diverging from them in ways that shed light on the significance of disciplinary norms and research infrastructures.",

translated into a new constitution and lower legislation a few years later, these general ideas laid down the two tracks along which the Dutch nation-state would develop after 1848. On the one hand, Thorbecke’s focus on ‘self-government’ emphasized the need for limited state intervention, even if the state more than before was guided by the people’s will (though expressed by only a very marginal portion of the people, as we shall see). On the other hand, the Liberal project of enabling citizens to realize their potential and to adequately voice their interests in the political arena meant that certain preconditions for the personal development of these citizens had to be met. These two elements – a small government nevertheless providing a certain level of safeguards for the development of its citizens – would also be central to the health care legislation of 1865.”</span>

in all, the final decades of the 19th century seem to present a break with Thorbeckian handsoff governance, as The Netherlands began to show a different face in economic and social affairs, a change which called for more safeguards by the state. However, it was clear that solutions to the new and growing social problems very much bore the mark of ‘1848’. In that year, a new Liberal ‘governmentality’ had been introduced for the way the Dutch nation-state would ideally be allowed to develop and flourish, according to the main architect of the new Dutch constitution, the Liberal statesman Johan Thorbecke.

Therefore, despite the fact that the arena of national politics was still dominated by confessional and Liberal factions who espoused a philosophy of state abstinence, important shifts in the financing and organization of health care were taking place ‘on the ground’. The steady growth of public arrangements had effects on what citizens came to expect from (local) government in terms of increasing access to health care.”</span> <span class=\"citation\"

parallel but less eye-catching development in The Netherlands is presented by the so-called ‘Cross Associations.’ After the turn of the century, these small, local associations mushroomed in rural areas across the country. Initially founded for fulfilling tasks in the area of public, collective health, nursing increasingly became for them a vital task. Curative interventions in the (psychiatric) hospital or specialist clinic were thus increasingly complemented by a type of care outsourced to small, local institutions financed through collective arrangements – something quite different from what would mostly have been care in the home by friends or family members before that time”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2272%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Bertens, 2021, p. 72</span>)</span>  Cross societies popping up \"at the turn of the century\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FF9LN72KR%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2273%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A72%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.82%2C545.009%2C514.177%2C556.06%5D%2C%5B70.824%2C528.179%2C522.967%2C539.23%5D%2C%5B70.824%2C511.379%2C513.474%2C522.43%5D%2C%5B70.824%2C494.579%2C539.196%2C507.13%5D%2C%5B70.824%2C477.659%2C540.123%2C488.71%5D%2C%5B70.824%2C460.859%2C530.866%2C471.91%5D%2C%5B70.824%2C444.059%2C516.301%2C455.11%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2273%22%7D%7D\">“A similar development took place with regards to the Cross Associations. The first of these had been founded by Jacobus Penn, a State Inspector for Health Care who by 1875 had become so disillusioned by the lack of municipal activity in the field of public health that he decided to organize a private service in Hilversum for furthering this cause.24 In a period in which the State Inspectorate, despite its best intentions, often failed to move municipal governments in furthering public health, this formula proved to be a great success.

Nevertheless, much like the Inspectors themselves, these institutions were outsiders in the local hierarchy, as they were formally instituted by central government.

These associations, which twenty years before had still been the exemplars of ‘private initiative’ in health care – though they had become increasingly dependent on government subsidies, as we have seen – under increasing financial pressure saw the benefit of officially being brought into the governmentally mandated insurance scheme. Veder-Smit managed to have a motion to that effect passed in 1979, and on January 1, 1980, the ‘Crosses’ came within the fold of Veldkamp’s broad national insurance. In terms of governmentality, this was a significant shift, as what had been the pinnacle of ‘private initiative’ in (public) health care arrangements for decades now became part of the national scheme of distributing funds for long-term care.144”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22200%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Bertens, 2021, p. 200</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FF9LN72KR%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22203%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A202%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72.024%2C704.741%2C314.7%2C719.935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22203%22%7D%7D\">“Van der Reijden’s ‘Minor’ System Reform”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22203%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Bertens, 2021, p. 203</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FF9LN72KR%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22204%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A203%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B456.22%2C375.659%2C525.386%2C386.71%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C358.719%2C487.891%2C369.77%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C341.919%2C512.464%2C352.97%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C325.119%2C532.181%2C336.17%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C308.319%2C511.78%2C319.37%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C291.519%2C512.673%2C302.57%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C274.599%2C517.632%2C285.65%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C257.799%2C522.062%2C268.85%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C240.999%2C525.57%2C252.05%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C224.199%2C506.512%2C235.25%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C207.399%2C487.585%2C218.45%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C190.449%2C524.872%2C201.5%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C173.649%2C140.445%2C186.2%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22204%22%7D%7D\">“in March 1986 Van der Reijden managed to get the Act on Access to Health Insurance (Wet Toegang Ziektekostenverzekering) accepted by Parliament. Through this act, voluntary sickness fund insurance (including the separate insurance scheme for the elderly) was dissolved. The insureds it concerned were instead divided amongst sickness funds (1,7 million) and private insurers (800.000), on the basis of their income. In line with Van der Reijden’s social motives, private insurers were now obliged to offer a standardized health insurance package with maximized premiums to those over 65, which effectively closed the option of risk selection or an endless raising of premiums for those formerly insured through a sickness fund. To further strengthen solidarity, two satellite acts were passed which forced those who were privately insured to contribute financially to the sickness funds’ portfolio (Act MOOZ), and to even out the differences between private insurers with a healthy portfolio and those with an unhealthy one (Act ILPZ).158 T”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22204%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Bertens, 2021, p. 204</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FF9LN72KR%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22205%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A204%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72.024%2C176.781%2C137.874%2C191.975%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22205%22%7D%7D\">“Conclusion”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22205%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Bertens, 2021, p. 205</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FF9LN72KR%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22209%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A208%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B108.38%2C703.541%2C503.74%2C720.001%5D%2C%5B78.744%2C659.609%2C533.251%2C670.66%5D%2C%5B132.02%2C642.809%2C480.22%2C653.86%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22209%22%7D%7D\">“Part IV: Governmentality of the Regulated Market, 1987-2015 In which the introduction of the ‘health care market’ goes back to an old governmentality, but the state’s role in providing access to health care grows larger than ever”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22209%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Bertens, 2021, p. 209</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FF9LN72KR%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22210%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A209%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72.024%2C704.741%2C148.19%2C719.935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22210%22%7D%7D\">“Introduction”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22210%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Bertens, 2021, p. 210</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FF9LN72KR%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22210%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A209%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B467.804%2C321.279%2C531.041%2C332.33%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C304.359%2C528.553%2C315.41%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C287.559%2C536.88%2C298.61%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C270.759%2C497.155%2C281.81%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C253.959%2C160.605%2C265.01%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22210%22%7D%7D\">“The proposal put forward in the important ‘Dekker-report’ of 1987 was one of instituting a ‘regulated health care market’: instead of the ‘paternalistic’, big government of the preceding decades, the parties in the field would once again have to take the reins in keeping costs in health care at an acceptable level.

The road to this universal insurance had not been without obstacles or paradoxes, as we have seen. Where the Social-Democrat Simons failed in introducing it, it would be the Liberal Hoogervorst who by 2005 managed to steer a broad, basic insurance with an unprecedented degree of income-levelling solidarity through Parliament. This happened after an intervening decade in which grand system reform was deemed anathema for having become synonymous with governmental overreach.

in line with the political-ideological thinking which had (for the most part) dominated debates about the state’s relation to the health care field since Thorbecke, autonomy would have to be given back to ‘field parties’ through the creation of a regulated market in health care. In 2006, these proposals were put into law. With the Health Insurance Act, the mandatory insurance scheme executed by private insurers came into force. And the Act on Market Regulation in Health Care gave the government (through its Healthcare Authority) the power to construct or develop the three distinct health care ‘markets’ which should serve to curb costs while increasing quality and the market power of health care ‘consumers’.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22271%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Bertens, 2021, p. 271</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FF9LN72KR%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22272%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A271%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B292.302%2C705.329%2C538.693%2C716.38%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C688.529%2C467.702%2C699.58%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C671.729%2C536.889%2C682.78%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C654.809%2C277.445%2C665.86%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22272%22%7D%7D\">“nstead, the new governmentality seems marked by the historically recurring mismatch between the rhetoric concerning the dominant governmentality in Dutch health care, and the actual reality of the state having an important say in how the field is organized and financed.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22272%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Bertens, 2021, p. 272</span>)</span>  This is too week - 'reality' is much focused on the top of the political pyramid</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FF9LN72KR%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22272%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A271%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B108.02%2C628.049%2C522.451%2C639.1%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C611.249%2C505.56%2C622.3%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C594.329%2C535.881%2C605.38%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C577.529%2C520.977%2C588.58%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C560.729%2C109.456%2C571.78%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F94YUYFPG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22272%22%7D%7D\">“Firstly, as far as ‘constructing’ markets is concerned, the state has kept its competition authorities on a tight leash, which has led to ever-growing concentrations of power in the insurance and hospital markets.

Although just four of them account for a vast majority of the health insurance market, these power positions have neither led to harsh insurance practices with regard to clients, nor to tough negotiation on prices with health care providers.

in the shadow of the Health Insurance Act, the Balkenende-cabinet in 2003 came up with a legislative proposal which would strengthen the responsibilities of municipalities to provide care, mostly in the form of social support. This proposal suggested an important overhaul concerning long-term care: to improve clarity as to what care citizens were entitled to, while it potentially also created budgetary space, services for those dependent on long-term care such as domestic help, housing and transport would be made a responsibility for municipalities.

De Adviescommissie Bekostiging Hoger Onderwijs en Onderzoek heeft haar adviesrapport aangeboden aan minister Van Engelshoven. In de afgelopen maanden boog de commissie, onder voorzitterschap van Martin van Rijn, zich over een herziening van de bekostiging van het hoger onderwijs en onderzoek. Er moeten nu wissels worden omgezet voor de aanpak van urgente knelpunten. Maar tegelijkertijd is volgens de commissie meer transparantie nodig in de kosten en is meer samenwerking in onderwijs en onderzoek essentieel voor resultaat op de langere termijn.",

The changing guidelines developed for viral diseases, for viruses in relation to cancer and to chronic central nervous system infection, and for causative agents in chronic diseases are discussed chronologically. A set of guidelines for both acute infectious and chronic diseases is presented. The need for recognizing the role of the host and the spectrum of host responses, for sound biologic sense in evaluating causal roles of agents in disease, and for flexibility in adapting our guidelines to new knowledge are emphasized.",

      "abstractNote": "De sociale geschiedenis van de verloskunde bestrijkt meer dan de beroepsgroep van verloskundigen en verloskunde artsen door de eeuwen heen, de hulp bij de bevalling en de verzorging van kraamvrouwen. Dit artikel richt zich op de prenatale zorg in de Nederlandse medische literatuur tot de zestiger jaren van de twintigste eeuw. De hippocratische adviezen van Van Beverwijck, de popularisering van medische kennis door Tissot, het beroep van Johan-Peter Frank op de verantwoordelijkheid van de Staat en de invloed van de hygiënistische beweging op de zorg voor zwangere vrouwen, gaan vooraf aan de ontwikkeling tijdens Interbellum, waarin de prenatale zorg integraal onderdeel werd van de preventieve geneeskunde en gezondheidszorg. De verloskundigen Klaas de Snoo en Balthazar S. ten Berge waren de pioniers van deze ontwikkeling, die in de naoorlogse periode resulteerde in twee belangrijke nationale congressen over prenatale zorg (1947, 1958) en een groot internationaal congres over prenatale geneeskunde (1959).",

Variations in the definition and measurement of intelligence between France and the United States can be attributed, he argues, to divergent understandings of equality in the two countries. In France, the democratic challenge is to represent existing social hierarchies as potentially open to all citizens. This has correlated with the assessment of merit through a standardized, state-administered educational system, in which performance according to collectively defined standards not birth nor heredity – is the putative guarantor of success. In the United States, by contrast, hierarchies of merit are publicly disavowed, education is highly decentralized, and the federal role in rearing educated citizens is both constitutionally and ideologically circumscribed. The peculiarly American commitment to standardized, quantified and privately administered intelligence testing has taken root in this context as an objective, “scientific” instrument for sorting and classifying citizens – yet one which, given its power to produce inequality, remains essentially contested”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">“States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order”, 2004, p. 10</span>)</span>  This distinction answer the question what had been the use of intelligence tests in constituting a specific social order.

So viewed, the workings of science and technology cease to be a thing apart from other forms of social activity, but are integrated instead as indispensable elements in the process of societal evolution. Science, made social in this way, can be compared and contrasted with other exercises in the production of power (Latour 1999; 1988a; 1987).

Foucault’s imprint is particularly apparent in work, including contributions to this volume, that deals with classification, standardization, and the accrual of power by institutions that have the capacity to discipline people’s bodies, minds and forms of life.

The term co-production reflects this self-conscious desire to avoid both social and technoscientific determinism in S&amp;TS accounts of the world.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">“States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order”, 2004, p. 20</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FUYE2BIFP%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%223BY43NQJ%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A33%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B54.004%2C573.5%2C377.986%2C582.71%5D%2C%5B54.004%2C561.5%2C377.976%2C570.71%5D%2C%5B54.004%2C549.5%2C207.831%2C558.71%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2221%22%7D%7D\">“His two orderings are more interactional than mutually constitutive in the sense implied by other observers of co-production, and the role of material objects in constituting order is left vague at best.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">“States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order”, 2004, p. 21</span>)</span>  I don't understand the difference between 'mutually constituitive\" and \"interactional\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FUYE2BIFP%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%2289E3MK2J%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A33%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B89.024%2C297.5%2C377.986%2C306.71%5D%2C%5B54.004%2C285.5%2C377.978%2C294.71%5D%2C%5B54.004%2C273.5%2C347.421%2C282.71%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2221%22%7D%7D\">““Science” and “politics” can then be treated as separate and distinct forms of activity rather than as strands of a single, tightly woven cultural enterprise through which human beings seek to make sense of their condition.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">“States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order”, 2004, p. 21</span>)</span>  Ok - here the object of study seems to point at \"a single, tightly woven cultural enterprise through which human beings seek to make sense of their condition\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FUYE2BIFP%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22FKKQXPA6%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A34%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.996%2C471.49%2C178.911%2C480.71%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2222%22%7D%7D\">“Constitutive co-production”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">“States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order”, 2004, p. 22</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FUYE2BIFP%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%223ZQL8TWX%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A34%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B155.718%2C393.5%2C377.987%2C402.71%5D%2C%5B53.996%2C381.5%2C377.967%2C390.71%5D%2C%5B53.996%2C369.5%2C377.973%2C378.71%5D%2C%5B53.996%2C357.5%2C377.969%2C366.71%5D%2C%5B53.996%2C345.5%2C377.967%2C354.71%5D%2C%5B53.996%2C333.5%2C377.984%2C342.71%5D%2C%5B53.996%2C321.5%2C377.978%2C330.71%5D%2C%5B53.995%2C309.5%2C211.561%2C318.71%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2222%22%7D%7D\">“It is the mechanism by which Western societies sort the multitudes of hybrid networks that constitute their cognitive and material existence into seemingly autonomous worlds of nature and culture.

From this starting point, Anderson defined the nation simply as “an imagined political community – and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign” (1991: 6).”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">“States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order”, 2004, p. 25</span>)</span>  This really adheres to Dewey: imagination enables to reflect about the possible worlds.

These observations underwrite what is for our purposes the authors’ most significant conclusion: “Solutions to the problem of knowledge are solutions to the problem of social order. That is why the materials in this book are contributions to political history as well as to the history of science” (Shapin and Schaffer 1985: 332).”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">“States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order”, 2004, p. 29</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FUYE2BIFP%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22RNT3CDTH%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2229%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A41%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B219.929%2C165.5%2C377.975%2C174.71%5D%2C%5B54.004%2C153.5%2C377.98%2C162.71%5D%2C%5B54.004%2C141.5%2C378.029%2C150.71%5D%2C%5B54.004%2C129.5%2C213.289%2C138.71%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2229%22%7D%7D\">“it may not be possible to address questions of the facticity and credibility of knowledge claims without, in effect, redrafting the rules of social order pertaining to the trustworthiness and authority of individuals and institutions”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">“States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order”, 2004, p. 29</span>)</span>  Interesting move: social orders is related to \"pertaining to the trustworthiness and authority of individuals and institutions\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FUYE2BIFP%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22WIDZKLCG%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2230%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A42%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.996%2C477.5%2C377.989%2C486.71%5D%2C%5B53.996%2C465.5%2C377.972%2C474.71%5D%2C%5B53.996%2C453.5%2C377.961%2C462.71%5D%2C%5B53.996%2C441.5%2C377.996%2C450.71%5D%2C%5B53.996%2C429.5%2C249.855%2C438.71%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2230%22%7D%7D\">“Although this statement assumes the separate existence of science and politics, the authors are careful not to posit unidirectional causal arrows running from one domain to the other.

of “laws of nature” is “indelibly marked by its political origins” (1985: 131). Once cast as a search for law, scientific research orients itself toward monocausal, hierarchical explanations in which nature is controlled by deterministic forces that dominate lower-order variables much in the manner of an authoritarian, centralized state ruling its subservient citizens. Such an understanding of nature, in Keller’s view, is anything but gender-neutral. She suggests that “order” rather than “law” would provide a richer (and presumably less masculine) framework for scientific inquiry, because the former term “wider than law, and free from its coercive, hierarchical, and centralizing implications, has the potential to expand our conception of science” (1985: 132).”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2235%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">“States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order”, 2004, p. 35</span>)</span>  But \"order\" seems to be explicitly hierarchical as well</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FUYE2BIFP%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22Q5ATT34I%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2235%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A47%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B194.12%2C309.5%2C377.993%2C318.71%5D%2C%5B54.004%2C297.5%2C377.993%2C306.71%5D%2C%5B54.004%2C285.5%2C377.963%2C294.71%5D%2C%5B54.004%2C273.5%2C171.194%2C282.71%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2235%22%7D%7D\">“An analysis of the cognitive, social, symbolic and even material resources with which the concept of gender is stabilized, would have told us a lot about what is at stake in the politics of femaleness in various socio-cultural settings”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9CW29CY3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2235%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">“States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order”, 2004, p. 35</span>)</span>  This really is codified language.

The co-production idiom, embracing as it does the constitutive as well as the interactional lines of thought, may offer at least a partial release from these dilemmas.

      "abstractNote": "Open Science (OS) increases the quality, efficiency, and impact of science. This has been widely recognised by scholars, funders, and policy makers. However, despite the increasing availability of infrastructure supporting OS and the rise in policies and incentives to change behavior, OS practices are not yet the norm. While pioneering researchers are developing and embracing OS practices, the majority sticks to the status quo. To transition from pioneering to common practice, we need to engage a critical proportion of the academic community. In this transition, Open Science Communities (OSCs) play a key role. OSCs are bottom-up learning groups of scholars that discuss OS practices, within and across disciplines. They make OS knowledge and know-how more visible and accessible, and facilitate communication among scholars and policy makers. By the same token, community members shape the transition to OS such that it is most beneficial for researchers, science, and society. Over the past two years, eleven OSCs were founded at several Dutch university cities, with approximately 700 members in total (at the time of writing). In other countries, similar OSCs are starting up. In this paper, we discuss the pivotal role OSCs play in the large-scale transition to OS and provide practical information on how to start a local OSC. We emphasize that, despite the grassroot character of OSCs, support from universities is critical for OSCs to be viable, effective, and sustainable.",

Within this context, the project called 'Integral Evaluation of Child Health Care' was initiated.

To begin with these do not, of course, constitute a static whole. At the time the first Child Health Clinics were established, some 100 years ago, the health of children was far worse than it is now. Because of poverty, ignorance of essential hygiene and lack of facilities, rampant infectious diseases and so on, infant mortality was very high (25% on average). Obviously, the main objective of 'Child Health Care' then was to fight such evils. The means used included social action, collective and individual education of mothers, the distribution of good quality milk and the opening of Child Health Clinics. As mortality and morbidity (from infectious diseases) decreased, the objectives of Child Health Care shifted. Gradually child development and 'mental hygiene' came into view as objects of care.”</span> <span class=\"citation\"

No percentages are known of the number of home visits made annually by district nurses, but they are estimated at one million per year (Bos &amp; De Winter 1989).

Health and health care are not static. The health situation of the population in care changes, old threats lessen and new risks may present themselves. Scientific opinions change, making new forms of intervention possible. For this reason the system of care should possess some degree of flexibility and the ability to meet new challenges with new methods.

the basis of the available literature it can be said that the present immunizations in the Netherlands are highly effective. The effectiveness is demonstrated by the fact that, after the introduction of immunizations against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, measles and rubella, the incidence rates went down to the present, extremely low, levels. Even though, as a result of improvements in conditions of social hygiene and the availability of sophisticated diagnostic procedures and therapeutics, the drop in mortality and morbidity rates had already started before immunization was introduced. The effect of the introduction of each immunization is clearly demonstrable.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 36</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22LEVDSWRK%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2237%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A49%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B104.535%2C439.132%2C431.49%2C450.539%5D%2C%5B93.506%2C426.659%2C431.389%2C438.068%5D%2C%5B93.31%2C414.426%2C147.642%2C425.832%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%7D\">“Considering the wide range of the R VP, Child Health Clinics obviously offer a good infrastructure for implementing the National Immunization Programme.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 37</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%226MRDUN8W%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2237%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A49%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66.14%2C315.657%2C222.063%2C331.856%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%7D\">“2.6 Recommendations”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 37</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%224X4KEREY%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2237%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A49%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B110.33%2C283.622%2C431.025%2C295.028%5D%2C%5B110.134%2C271.849%2C431.336%2C283.258%5D%2C%5B110.134%2C260.1%2C431.581%2C271.508%5D%2C%5B110.13%2C248.102%2C431.106%2C259.508%5D%2C%5B110.014%2C236.102%2C431.067%2C247.509%5D%2C%5B110.052%2C224.339%2C224.188%2C235.746%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%7D\">“It is recommended that the R VP with its executive, administrative, monitoring and evaluation functions be maintained.

In the Netherlands, virtually all neonates are screened for PKU and CHT. PKU screening was introduced in 1974, CHT screening in 1981. The screening for PKU and CHT is a form of standardized programmed prevention. The aim of the screening is to detect the disorders at the earliest possible stage so that, through prompt treatment, the consequences of the diseases can be prevented. In this chapter, the disorders are described, then the organization of the screening is discussed.”</span> <span class=\"citation\"

The development of good hearing is of great significance for development as a whole and notably for speech development and language acquisition. Late discovery ofhearing impairment may result in a disruption of development. At Child Health Clinics the hearing functions of young children have always been checked, but from the 1960s onward this has takenplace systematically on all children by means of a standardized screening method: the Ewing test (Ewing &amp; Ewing 1944). The aim of this method is to detect all hearing impairments at the age of about 9 months. In this chapter, normal hearing is briefly discussed, then the various types of impairment. Subsequently, attention is given to the problem of secretory otitis media (SOM) and its detection, the objective and function of screening and the methodsof measuring whether or not the objectivehas been or is being attained. Then two other methods for the detection of hearing impairment used in the Netherlands are discussed and finally the recommendations by the project group are given.”</span> <span class=\"citation\"

Ewing test is a relatively good screening method for the detection of hearing impairment in children about 9 months old. The test has good coverage, the validity data available present a positive picture of it. During the Project Group's discussions however the point was raised that the follow-up (after a negative result) often leaves a lot to be desired. Frequently, too much time elapses between a disorder being suspected and the diagnosis being made (and the start of treatment).”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2273%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 73</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22P6E9AMWF%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2273%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A85%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B418.49%2C420.64%2C427.413%2C432.158%5D%2C%5B89.268%2C408.4%2C427.479%2C419.918%5D%2C%5B89.416%2C396.399%2C427.666%2C407.916%5D%2C%5B89.032%2C384.148%2C427.501%2C395.668%5D%2C%5B89.17%2C372.15%2C427.279%2C383.668%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2273%22%7D%7D\">“In reply, the Netherlands Foundation for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired Child (Nederlandse Stichting voor het Dove en Slechthorende Kind), which takes care of training for the Ewing test as well as its organization and administration, stated that they are drawing up a national referral protocol.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2273%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 73</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22DYGHANVA%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2273%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A85%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B88.979%2C359.92%2C427.169%2C371.438%5D%2C%5B88.951%2C347.68%2C427.202%2C359.197%5D%2C%5B89.18%2C335.68%2C427.742%2C347.198%5D%2C%5B88.95%2C323.43%2C427.104%2C334.948%5D%2C%5B89.067%2C311.429%2C291.953%2C322.946%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2273%22%7D%7D\">“Finally, a point that is stressed by many national and international authors: good, regularly repeated information for parents, in which the importance of screening is explained and which explains the significance of an insufficient reaction and of its repetition is of great importance.

Vision defects that are unidentified or are identified too late may lead to (irreparable) impairment of vision, which can cause delayed and/or disturbed general development. Until a few years ago, there was no systematic method for the detection of visual defects that was workable in the clinic. Even though the Van Wiechen check-lise includes a number of items aimed at the assessment of the visual faculty, there was a clear need for standardization of research, evaluation of results, uniformity and promotion of quality and expertise in this field (Lantau 1989). To meet this need a standardized method was introduced aimed at the detection of visual defects at the clinic, Early Detection of Vision Defects (VOV: Vroegtijdige Opsporing van Visuele stoornissen).”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2277%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 77</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22FVVANTXU%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2279%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A91%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65.81%2C334.991%2C377.186%2C351.749%5D%2C%5B92.82%2C313.871%2C291.635%2C330.629%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2279%22%7D%7D\">“5.3 The importance of early detection (and treatment) of vision defects”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2279%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 79</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%225RSQDDCK%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2279%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A91%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B93.03%2C282.422%2C431.236%2C293.828%5D%2C%5B93.006%2C270.422%2C432.184%2C281.829%5D%2C%5B93.02%2C258.662%2C431.623%2C270.068%5D%2C%5B93.371%2C246.662%2C430.668%2C258.069%5D%2C%5B93.03%2C234.662%2C431.6%2C246.068%5D%2C%5B92.9%2C222.662%2C429.318%2C234.068%5D%2C%5B93.104%2C210.899%2C431.306%2C222.308%5D%2C%5B93.252%2C199.139%2C426.821%2C210.548%5D%2C%5B93.17%2C187.142%2C431.194%2C198.548%5D%2C%5B93.723%2C175.142%2C177.086%2C186.549%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2279%22%7D%7D\">“The importance of early detection of visual defects is generally acknowledged.

The most common arguments for the detection of amblyopia are firstly that persons with amblyopia run a greater risk of sustaining a disorder in the healthy eye3 and secondly that in certain occupations ever higher demands are made on the acuity of vision of both eyes (Loewer-Sieger et al. 1987, National Counselling Committee for Early Detection of Vision Defects (LBC-VOV) 1988)”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2279%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 79</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%223PATC5HY%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2282%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A94%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B62.92%2C598.081%2C429.828%2C615.844%5D%2C%5B91.085%2C576.965%2C178.074%2C594.729%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2282%22%7D%7D\">“5.5 Tests for early detection of vision defects in the Netherlands”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2282%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 82</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22SM5CRVWR%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2282%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A94%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B55.52%2C449.556%2C278.496%2C465.867%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2282%22%7D%7D\">“5.5.1 The Early Detection method”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2282%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 82</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22TPCVL73K%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2282%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A94%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.39%2C424.71%2C430.609%2C436.228%5D%2C%5B90.14%2C412.71%2C430.754%2C424.228%5D%2C%5B90.377%2C400.709%2C431.464%2C412.228%5D%2C%5B90.21%2C388.48%2C430.688%2C399.998%5D%2C%5B90.144%2C376.24%2C297.939%2C387.758%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2282%22%7D%7D\">“The Early Detection method is a systematized method of examination to detect defects of the eyes, their position and movement in babies and young children.

This 'follow-up route' does not appear to have been very well streamlined in all places, anyway; often months pass by between a referral by the clinic and subsequent specialist assessment.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 91</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%227R2VJ8QG%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2291%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A103%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B58.36%2C441.382%2C216.534%2C459.033%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%7D\">“5.8 Recommendations”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 91</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%2258QVUGPV%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2291%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A103%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B124.49%2C415.6%2C423.476%2C427.118%5D%2C%5B125.13%2C403.6%2C423.169%2C415.118%5D%2C%5B125.268%2C391.599%2C424.003%2C403.118%5D%2C%5B125.41%2C379.6%2C423.835%2C391.118%5D%2C%5B125.19%2C367.36%2C262.163%2C378.878%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%7D\">“In view of the positive results in other countries with tests for stereoscopic vision for the detection of amblyopia, it is recommended that the applicability of this method within the Child Health Services for pre-school children be further investigated in the short term.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 91</span>)</span> Again: methods are adopted to its organised context</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22ELYT67RP%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2291%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A103%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B124.49%2C294.15%2C423.854%2C305.724%5D%2C%5B125.18%2C282.398%2C423.742%2C293.918%5D%2C%5B125.037%2C270.149%2C423.63%2C281.668%5D%2C%5B125.19%2C258.638%2C423.34%2C270.158%5D%2C%5B125.07%2C246.639%2C423.553%2C258.158%5D%2C%5B125.129%2C234.878%2C423.602%2C246.398%5D%2C%5B125.263%2C222.879%2C423.74%2C234.398%5D%2C%5B124.74%2C210.879%2C423.92%2C222.398%5D%2C%5B125.01%2C199.12%2C423.998%2C210.638%5D%2C%5B125.17%2C187.12%2C421.283%2C198.638%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%7D\">“It is recommended that the Early Detection programme be continued for the time being.

In the biological model, a developmental impairment is seen to be caused by constitutional abnormalities or disorders. In the environmental model, negative environmental influences are blamed; in the interactive model both factors may be considered to give rise to impairment. Finally, in the transactional view, developmental impairments are seen to be the result of unfavourably proceeding transactions (interactions) between child and environment, whereby the child gets insufficient or no chance to adapt to its world, and then to (re)organize and to (re)structure its world. It is assumed in this view that man possesses a 'self-regulating power' (Sameroff 1975). The breadth of the concept of development, as outlined above, constitutes an extra complication when describing the concept of developmental impairment, particularly in the framework of a transactional model.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2297%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 97</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%222LX8YFZH%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2298%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A110%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B236.55%2C561.52%2C428.379%2C573.038%5D%2C%5B88.93%2C549.28%2C429.426%2C560.798%5D%2C%5B89.29%2C537.28%2C429.56%2C548.798%5D%2C%5B89.64%2C525.04%2C429.272%2C536.558%5D%2C%5B88.994%2C512.789%2C427.912%2C524.308%5D%2C%5B88.93%2C500.55%2C429.057%2C512.068%5D%2C%5B88.75%2C488.32%2C429.5%2C499.838%5D%2C%5B88.919%2C476.08%2C428.484%2C487.598%5D%2C%5B89.03%2C463.83%2C161.32%2C475.348%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2298%22%7D%7D\">“Thus the age at which the abnormality is established determines its prevalence in an age group.

Finally, in a study by Schlesinger-Was in 1981, which to some extent formed the basis of the Van Wiechen check-list, a prevalence figure of 3-5% was established.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2298%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 98</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22IH4NBP8P%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2298%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A110%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B61.26%2C419.264%2C423.264%2C435.798%5D%2C%5B89.18%2C398.154%2C171.631%2C414.688%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2298%22%7D%7D\">“6.3 Aim and outcome measures of developmental surveillance”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2298%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 98</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22FKZDW6R8%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2298%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A110%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B88.95%2C369.27%2C429.431%2C380.788%5D%2C%5B88.93%2C357.04%2C429.322%2C368.558%5D%2C%5B88.887%2C345.039%2C429.002%2C356.558%5D%2C%5B89.395%2C332.8%2C429.01%2C344.318%5D%2C%5B88.952%2C320.799%2C429.547%2C332.318%5D%2C%5B88.79%2C308.55%2C189.202%2C320.068%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2298%22%7D%7D\">“The general objective of pre-school Child Health Care is to secure and advance health, growth and development.

In the checklist manual (Van Wiechen Working Party 1983) a developmental impairment (for want of an unequivocal definition) is described as follows: 'Development is a ripening process of the central nervous system and the senses. A developmental impairment is the result of a disturbance of this process, manifested by a different progress in functioning to that expected. What must be understood by \"normal\" or \"expected\" depends on culture, socio-economic circumstances, the child's sex, the constellation of the family or home environment, the physical environment (town or country) and on many other factors. Thus the child's situation at the time that its development is screened must not differ too much from the situation in which what is considered \"normal\" was determined. This is resolved in the new check-list by making as much use as possible of the reference values established at child health clinics for healthy children' (Schlesinger-Was 1981) (Van Wiechen Working Party 1983).

Although the final diagnosis is not included as a separate question in the check-list, the preliminary impression from the material now available is that it is known for a great proportion of the children.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22105%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 105</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22FTK7PPHX%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22105%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A117%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B88.95%2C370.71%2C427.108%2C382.228%5D%2C%5B89.129%2C358.48%2C425.21%2C369.998%5D%2C%5B89.189%2C346.24%2C426.916%2C357.758%5D%2C%5B89.177%2C334.239%2C425.821%2C345.758%5D%2C%5B88.89%2C321.99%2C427.067%2C333.508%5D%2C%5B89.185%2C309.989%2C426.488%2C321.508%5D%2C%5B89.01%2C297.75%2C176.263%2C309.267%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22105%22%7D%7D\">“The real effectiveness, or cost effectiveness, of standardized developmental surveillance at the child health clinics can only be reliably measured by a longitudinal study.

A number of authors14 hold that the problem cannot be solved by well-structured questionnaires and interviews; they believe that parents can supply reliable information only on the child's use of language and not about its comprehension, because parents often (wrongly) take for granted that their child understands all they say.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22120%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 120</span>)</span> This is interesting in concretising the role of parents in examination</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22S6GXQ2HN%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22120%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A132%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B60.07%2C431.118%2C307.053%2C447.206%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22120%22%7D%7D\">“7.6.6 Com pari ng the various methods”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22120%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 120</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%225R2G9Z5B%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22120%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A132%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B94.78%2C406.48%2C431.025%2C417.998%5D%2C%5B94.701%2C394.24%2C434.7%2C405.758%5D%2C%5B94.936%2C381.989%2C435.208%2C393.508%5D%2C%5B95.03%2C369.75%2C432.828%2C381.268%5D%2C%5B95.03%2C357.52%2C434.499%2C369.038%5D%2C%5B94.821%2C345.519%2C434.84%2C357.038%5D%2C%5B94.937%2C333.269%2C433.917%2C344.788%5D%2C%5B95.01%2C321.04%2C434.803%2C332.558%5D%2C%5B94.703%2C308.8%2C353.804%2C320.318%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22120%22%7D%7D\">“A comparison of the above methods shows there to be considerable differences between the tests as far as the ages are concerned at which they are used for the first time.

What this official does, and how often he or she does it, appears to be flexible: time and time again, the content and procedures of the periodic medical examination have been adapted to changing insights, not only in the course of the history of pre-school Child Health Care, but also today there are enormous differences internationally. In the Netherlands, for example, the term periodic medical examination has come to refer to the longitudinal follow-up and assessment of the growth and development of the young child including, of course, history taking and the giving of advice as needed. Depending on the definition that is chosen, the periodic medical examination is taken to mean either the regular physical examination alone, or a combination of the physical examination, screenings, developmental assessment, educational prevention activities and counselling, health education, and sometimes also immunization.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22126%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 126</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22HY644BH7%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22126%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A138%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B155.502%2C150.149%2C428.507%2C161.668%5D%2C%5B88.468%2C137.92%2C364.761%2C149.438%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22126%22%7D%7D\">“A broad definition of this kind is similar to what is referred to in the English-speaking world as Child Health Surveillance.1”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22126%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 126</span>)</span> Good to know</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22UTJM6AUN%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22126%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A138%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B88.74%2C108.288%2C428.035%2C117.923%5D%2C%5B88.324%2C96.996%2C428.548%2C106.756%5D%2C%5B88.241%2C85.714%2C429.187%2C95.353%5D%2C%5B88.24%2C74.438%2C429.187%2C84.073%5D%2C%5B88%2C63.398%2C335.22%2C73.033%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22126%22%7D%7D\">“IHall (1989) describes Child Health Surveillance as 'a set of activities which are initiated by professionals.

Firstly, the methods available for health assessment have become highly differentiated over the past decades. In various domains in the field of health and development, specific research methods, often standardized, have been developed which now operate more or less independently within the structure of the clinics.

Proponents of a narrow definition (as reflected, for example, in the British model put forward by Hall and others, which is discussed in detail below) tend to hold the view that a programme for periodic health examination that is actively offered to parents should include only screenings that have been proved reliable and valid.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22128%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 128</span>)</span> Nice - classic boundary work</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%226BS4ARB5%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22128%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A140%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B411.03%2C171.51%2C429.283%2C183.028%5D%2C%5B88.94%2C159.51%2C429.426%2C171.028%5D%2C%5B89.01%2C147.28%2C429.142%2C158.798%5D%2C%5B88.932%2C135.04%2C429.124%2C146.558%5D%2C%5B89.01%2C123.03%2C429.119%2C134.548%5D%2C%5B89.174%2C111.029%2C176.873%2C122.548%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22128%22%7D%7D\">“The conclusion that the term periodic medical examination obscures rather than clarifies, seems justified.

He describes the latter component as 'the vigilant supervision of all aspects of the health and wellbeing of children whenever they come into contact with health care professionals'. It is concerned with 'seeing whether anything is wrong' rather than with 'looking for a particular condition'. However, with respect to this surveillance component, Butler draws attention to an important evaluation problem: whatever the importance of this form of 'many-faceted diagnostic awareness' might be, it is virtually impossible to quantify or measure. 'How much of this kind of oversight is done, by whom, at what cost, and to what effect, are questions upon which the literature can throw almost no light' (Butler 1989).”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22130%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 130</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%229G4XD7DC%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22131%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A143%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B102.897%2C511.598%2C426.893%2C523.118%5D%2C%5B92.414%2C499.36%2C428.569%2C510.877%5D%2C%5B92.04%2C487.108%2C430.149%2C498.628%5D%2C%5B92.17%2C474.88%2C429.948%2C486.398%5D%2C%5B92.155%2C462.879%2C429.936%2C474.398%5D%2C%5B92.14%2C450.64%2C429.698%2C462.158%5D%2C%5B91.9%2C438.64%2C427.101%2C450.158%5D%2C%5B91.895%2C426.4%2C430.129%2C437.918%5D%2C%5B92.17%2C414.15%2C424.667%2C425.668%5D%2C%5B91.827%2C402.149%2C430.154%2C413.668%5D%2C%5B92.052%2C389.92%2C110.184%2C401.438%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22131%22%7D%7D\">“In addition to the observation of the child, and of the interaction between the child and its parents, the child may be examined for various aspects of health: physical health, growth and development (including biometric tests, examination of the eyes, ear-nose-throat, digestive system, heart and blood vessels, urogenital tract, locomotor and skin), psychomotor development and examination of language and speech development.

The aim of the study was to provide a sound basis for the work of doctors in clinics. In his foreword, Vaandrager states 'this manual for periodic health examination in clinics can be regarded as a first step on the way to a protocol'.

far, attitudes in the Dutch Child Health Care system have been rather sceptical about the role ascribed to parents in the United Kingdom. The lack of insight into the reliability of parent information probably has a lot to do with this. Moreover, the need to reassure parents (in answer to the question: 'Is my child healthy, and if so, is it as healthy as possible?') is highly rated among Dutch Child Health Care professionals. While, in the United Kingdom, parents can consult a doctor when they are concerned about their child, the system in the Netherlands is such that there are frequent contacts with the parents to prevent a situation developing in which parents become worried about the health and/or development of their child.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22144%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 144</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22KU6H45XQ%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22144%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A156%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.25%2C157.231%2C168.364%2C169.412%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22144%22%7D%7D\">“The Netherlands”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22144%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 144</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22SZK5AWZE%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22144%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A156%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B89.02%2C140.08%2C424.169%2C151.598%5D%2C%5B89.127%2C127.84%2C429.219%2C139.358%5D%2C%5B89.17%2C115.589%2C429.209%2C127.108%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22144%22%7D%7D\">“A frequent notification schedule, care is highly-structured, but (as yet) standardized only to a limited extent.

The fact that a new form of organization and content has been realized in a number of districts in the United Kingdom, now makes empirical comparison of the two systems possible. Of course, the first question to ask is: to what extent are the two systems comparable, considering the different organizational and epidemiological contexts of the Dutch and British health care systems? A second question is whether the differences are as great in practice as the ideal programmes would suggest. One might, for example, assume that the total number of visits that parents pay to consultatiebureaus or Child Health Clinics does not differ very much: parents who are seldom called up may well make frequent use of open clinics. In view of the fact that there is practically no data on outcomes available for either of the s~stems, it would seem evident that a study should be done on this aspect 7.

Hopman and Vroonhof however, find that the quantity of child rearing guidance does not meet this aim. Moreover they argue that the information is included in the Growth Book in the form of advice, which is outdated from the point of view of modern information science. They contend that the parents, being primarily responsible for their child, are quite capable of making their own choices about what to do, provided they are well-informed. Finally the guidance is found to be in disagreement with new scientific opinion and current social developments.

As to the first objection, Merkx states that the experience with the Growth Book is that the percentage of lost copies is low. Hopman and Vroonhof (1992) arrive at the same result: the 183 parents polled by them kept the Growth Book carefully. With regard to the second objection, Merkx poses that openness on sensitive subjects (for instance suspected child abuse) may assist early detection.

In this chapter the focus is on the social and physical environment of children and parents as a health determinant.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22184%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 184</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22D7J3SC3P%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22184%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A196%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B57.28%2C257.994%2C321.599%2C274.528%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22184%22%7D%7D\">“11.1 Health and environment factors”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22184%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">De Winter, 1995, p. 184</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FQZVU64JR%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%2238H4EISL%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22184%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A196%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B91.11%2C226.874%2C431.262%2C238.834%5D%2C%5B91.11%2C214.874%2C432.434%2C226.835%5D%2C%5B91.22%2C202.634%2C431.552%2C214.594%5D%2C%5B91.163%2C190.394%2C431.845%2C202.358%5D%2C%5B91.293%2C178.395%2C427.149%2C190.355%5D%2C%5B91.174%2C166.154%2C268.229%2C178.119%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2F9J8ISY6J%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22184%22%7D%7D\">“Today, illness, health, and normal or problematic development are generally seen against the background of a complex combination of personally or environmentally linked variables.

      "abstractNote": "The first International Conference on Health Promotion, meeting in Ottawa this 21st day of November 1986, hereby presents this CHARTER for action to achieve Health For All by the year 2000 and beyond.This conference was primarily a response to growing exceptions for a new public health movement around the world. Discussions focused on the needs in industrialized countries, but took into account similar concerns in all other regions. It built on the progress made through the Declaration of Primary Health Care at Alma Ata, the World Health Organization's Targets for Health For All document, and the recent debate at the World Health Assembly on intersectoral action for health.",

De verdeeling der patienten<br />is door mij evenwel naar beste weten opgesteld en 21j heeft de<br />goedkeuring van mijn beide ambtsgenooten verkregen. Of er nu nog<br />iets aan te veranderen is, zal moeten blijken. cecr belangrijke<br />wijzigingen zullen, naar ik verwacht, niet mogolijk zijn.<br /><br />Ik vraaz evenwel Collega Koenen, die thans op vacantie is,<br />doch den 16den zijn werk zal hervatten, U een en anier mondeling , |<br />toe te lichten en met U te onderzoeken. Er moet n.l. rekening ’<br />mede worden zehouden dat het evacuatieplan ontworpen is moecten a<br />worden om het hoofd te bieden aan een eventuesle massale, waarlijk<br /><br />ee. katastrophale ontruimins van de tien in het kustgebied gelegen<br />gestichten en psychiatrische inrichtin en. Gelukxig evenwel zijn<br />er aanwijzingen voor de hoop dat hot plan niet, althans niet in<br />zijn geheel behoeft te worden ultgevoerd, doch in de huidige<br />situatie is mon van niets zeker, zoodat er eon plan most zijn an<br />volgens hetwelk de patienten spoediz en geheel door eigen krachten |<br />in veiligheid kunnen worden yebracht indien de ontruiming gelast<br />mocht worden.<br /><br />Meer in het bijzonder wat de JU toe te bedeelen patienten<br />betreft lijkt mij de kans dat zij geheel of srootendeels weg-<br />blijven niet ongunstig met het oog op de ligging van de St.Willi-<br />brordusstichting, Pantpoort en Endegesst. Lam<br /><br />Niettemin meen ik ook na kennisneming van Uw brief aanvanke-~<br />lijk te moeten volharden bij het plan voor Uw inrichting. Ik ver»<br />moed, dat somnige bezwaren, welke op het eerste gezicht onover-~<br />komelijk lexen, na overweging kunnen worden overwonnen.<br />indien het verdeelen der wanme maaltijden over den gehee<br />niet voldoende blijkt, een hulpkeuken kunnen worden ingericht<br />waarvocor het materiaal, indien niet te koop, zou kunnen worden<br />gevorderd. Indien de capaciteit der wasscherij niet voldoende<br />zou zijn, zou men gedeeltelijk buitenshuis kunnen laten wasschen.<br /><br />Gaarne zou ik zien dat Gij in dit kader een en ander<br />overweegt en zoo spoedig mo<br />komt nel.<br /><br />ee<br /><br />Zoo zou,<br />len dag<br /><br />al<br /><br />nog eens<br />gelijk een plan gereed hebt; het bevel<br />naar wij mogen hopen niet of voorloopig niet doch het<br /><br />kan ook morgen komen en dan moeten wij paraat zijn.<br /><br />Met coll.groe<br />Den Heer Dr.G.Janssens groshen,<br /><br />Gaarne 4%<br />Geneesheer-Directeur (get) J.H.

      "abstractNote": "This essay traces the main ways in which photography was taken up and used by supporters of the eugenics movement, from the time that Darwin's cousin, the British polymath Francis Galton, first used it to demonstrate the role played by heredity in human intelligence, to the early 1940s, when the eugenics movement lost much of its appeal. It is argued that Galton's composite photographs of the socially “fit” and “unfit” members of British society only broadly determined the pattern for how American and Australian eugenicists deployed photography, and that each country's differing social tensions caused them to evolve their own diverse set of photographic practices aimed at promulgating the eugenic cause. Using photographic examples drawn from Britain, the USA and Australia, the essay identifies the leading persons and eugenics organisations that deployed photography, the different kinds of photographic genres they used and the different ideological and statist ends to which their images were put. It concludes that compared to Britain where class differences were highlighted, the USA and Australia's strong respective histories of slavery and colonisation led to a more robust emphasis on race and in particular the preserving of racial purity and expansion of the white population.",

      "abstractNote": "ABSTRACTAt a time when neoliberalism and financial austerity are together encouraging academic scientists to seek market alternatives to state funding, this essay investigates why, a century ago, their predecessors explicitly rejected private enterprise and the private ownership of ideas and inventions available to them through the patent system. The early twentieth century witnessed the success of a long campaign by British scientists to persuade the state to assume responsibility for the funding of basic research (“pure science”): their findings would enter the intellectual commons; their rewards would be primarily reputational (financial only secondarily, through consequent career advancement). The essay summarizes recent research in three separate fields of British technoscience—electricity, aviation, and agricultural botany—all of which were laying claim, at this time, to a heightened commercial or military importance that raised new questions about the ownership of scientific ideas. It suggests that each of the three established an idiosyncratic relationship with the patent system or with other forms of “intellectual property,” which would both influence their emergent disciplines and affect the extent to which commercial enterprise could remain a viable funding strategy.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent initiatives toward open science in communication have prompted vigorous debate. In this article, we draw on qualitative and interpretive research methods to expand the key priorities that the open science framework addresses, namely producing trustworthy and quality research. This article contributes to communication research by integrating qualitative methodological literature with open communication science research to identify five broader commitments for all communication research: validity, transparency, ethics, reflexivity, and collaboration. We identify key opportunities where qualitative and quantitative communication scholars can leverage the momentum of open science to critically reflect on and improve our knowledge production processes. We also examine competing values that incentivize dubious practices in communication research, and discuss several metascience initiatives to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field and value multiple ways of knowing.",

We find a positive and significant impact of funding on collaboration which is measured in terms of the number of co-authors for publications in peer-reviewed journals. Our identification strategy is based on comparing collaboration indicators for researchers with financially supported projects with those of a control group of researchers who submitted projects that were accepted in terms of quality, but not supported because of shortage of funds. We obtain consistent results by using different non-experimental techniques including difference-in-differences models combined with propensity score matching algorithms.",

      "abstractNote": "The term “epigenetics” was introduced in 1942 by embryologist Conrad Waddington, who, relating it to the 17th century concept of “epigenesis”, defined it as the complex of developmental processes between the genotype and phenotype. While in the years that followed, these processes – in particular gene regulation – were tackled, not in the frame of epigenetics but of genetics, research labelled “epigenetics” rose strongly only in the 21st century. Then it consisted of research on chromatin modifications, i.e. chemical modifications of DNA or histone proteins around DNA that do not change the base sequence. This rise was accompanied by far-reaching claims, such as that epigenetics provides a mechanism for “Lamarckian” inheritance. This article highlights the origin of epigenetics, the major phases of epigenetic research, and the changes in the meaning of the term. It also calls into question some of the far-reaching claims that have accompanied the recent rise of epigenetics.",

      "abstractNote": "The shift towards open innovation has substantially changed the academic and practical understanding of corporate innovation. While academic studies on open innovation are burgeoning, most research on the topic focuses on the later phases of the innovation process. So far, the impact and implications of the general tendency towards more openness in academic and industrial science at the very front-end of the innovation process have been mostly neglected. Our paper presents a conceptualization of this open science as a new research paradigm. Based on empirical data and current literature, we analyze the phenomenon and propose four perspectives of open science. Furthermore, we outline current trends and propose directions for future developments.",

      "abstractNote": "The journal impact factor ( ) is, by far, the most discussed bibliometric indicator. Since its introduction over 40 years ago, it has had enormous effects on the scientific ecosystem: transforming the publishing industry, shaping hiring practices and the allocation of resources, and, as a result, reorienting the research activities and dissemination practices of scholars. Given both the ubiquity and impact of the indicator, the JIF has been widely dissected and debated by scholars of every disciplinary orientation. Drawing on the existing literature as well as original research, this chapter provides a brief history of the indicator and highlights well-known limitations—such as the asymmetry between the numerator and the denominator, differences across disciplines, the insufficient citation window, and the skewness of the underlying citation distributions. The inflation of the JIF and the weakening predictive power is discussed, as well as the adverse effects on the behaviors of individual actors and the research enterprise. Alternative journal-based indicators are described and the chapter concludes with a call for responsible application and a commentary on future developments in journal indicators.",

      "abstractNote": "August Weismann is famous for having argued against the inheritance of acquired characters. However, an analysis of his work indicates that Weismann always held that changes in external conditions, acting during development, were the necessary causes of variation in the hereditary material. For much of his career he held that acquired germ-plasm variation was inherited. An irony, which is in tension with much of the standard twentieth-century history of biology, thus exists – Weismann was not a Weismannian. I distinguish three claims regarding the germ-plasm: (1) its continuity,(2) its morphological sequestration, and (3) its variational sequestration. With respect to changes in Weismann's views on the cause of variation, I divide his career into four stages. For each stage I analyze his beliefs on the relative importance of changes in external conditions and sexual reproduction as causes ofvariation in the hereditary material. Weismann believed, and Weismannism denies, that variation, heredity, and development were deeply intertwined processes. This article is part of a larger project comparing commitments regarding variation during the latter half of the nineteenth century.",

      "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT: In this paper, I focus on the contribution of the social economy to the democratization of the State and of public policy by making use of the distinction between the concepts of co-production and co-construction. In part one, I clarify the meanings given to various concepts. In particular, I pay attention to the idea of a co-production of public policy. This concept relates to the organizational dimension of policy and enables a contextualization of the participation of both civil society stakeholders and market forces in the implementation of services to the public. In part two, I discuss the concept of co-construction which relates to the institutional dimension of public policy and enables an analysis of how both civil society stakeholders and market forces are defining public policies. While the co-construction of public policy can produce various types of outcomes, I favor a solidarity-based model in which the State is open to forms of governance inclusive of the contributions of civil society stakeholders and market forces. This type of co-construction is fitting with a concern for the general interest and is ready to use the resources of the social economy. In part three, I review the housing policy case study in Canada and Quebec during the last twenty years. Three observations emerge from this case study: 1) the presence of both co-production and co-construction in public housing policy; 2) an active presence of the social economy such as co-operatives and non-profit organizations; 3) this active presence of the social economy has helped to produce a number of social innovations that have improved the democratization of public policy in the housing field.",

      "abstractNote": "This essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing, with special attention to the example of Elsevier. A scholarly publisher can be defined as a surveillance publisher if it derives a substantial proportion of its revenue from prediction products, fueled by data extracted from researcher behavior. The essay begins by tracing the Google search engine’s roots in bibliometrics, alongside a history of the citation analysis company that became, in 2016, Clarivate. The point is to show the co-evolution of scholarly communication and the surveillance advertising economy. The essay then refines the idea of surveillance publishing by engaging with the work of Shoshana Zuboff, Jathan Sadowski, Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, and Aziz Huq. The recent history of Elsevier is traced to describe the company’s research-lifecycle data-harvesting strategy, with the aim to develop and sell prediction products to universities and other customers. The essay concludes by considering some of the potential costs of surveillance publishing, as other big commercial publishers increasingly enter the predictive-analytics mark. It is likely, I argue, that windfall subscription-and-APC profits in Elsevier’s “legacy” publishing business have financed its decade-long acquisition binge in analytics, with the implication that university customers are budgetary victims twice over. The products’ purpose, I stress, is to streamline the top-down assessment and evaluation practices that have taken hold in recent decades, in tandem with the view that the university’s main purpose is to grow regional and national economies. A final pair of concerns is that publishers’ prediction projects may camouflage and perpetuate existing biases in the system—and that scholars may internalize an analytics mindset, one already encouraged by citation counts and impact factors.",

In drie afzonderlijke, zeer eenvou­ dige localiteiten, over de zeer uitgestrekte gemeente doelmatig verspreid, komen de moeders op voor ieder van haar opengehouden tijdstip ter bestraling van de kiemen, die vooraf onder de bekende voorzorgen door den dokter zijn uitge­ kozen. Dit nu kunnen de moeders wel, een of meer keeren per week. Zij weten, dat zij er met een kwartiertje af zijn en bovendien is de afstand naar haar lokaal zoo klein mogelijk gekozen (hoogstens 2 kilometer). Bovendien, 't besef dat er iets speciaal aan haar kind „gedaan\" wordt! Een drietal clubjes, ieder van vier dames uit de gemeente, belasten zich vrijwillig met het toezicht, met 't bezighouden der kleinen tijdens de bestraling en handreiking aan de moeders. Dokter en zuster houden oppertoezicht. De resultaten zijn zeer goed. Met medewerking van het Witte Kruis hoopt men te zijner tijd tot eenvoudige, maar beter ingerichte Solaria te kunnen komen. In 1933 waren 74 kindertjes onder bestraling. De moeders betalen slechts 5 cent per bestraling voor stroomkosten. Alle gegevens worden in een kaart­ systeem ondergebracht. Kan men zich in dit geval betere preventie denken?

B. bezochten.Een zeker gevoel van onvoldaan­ heid heerscht er dikwijls bij den staf van een zuigelingenbureau, wanneer na een jaar het contact moet verbroken worden. Slechts 'n enkele ontkomt er aan door aan zekere moeders toe te staan om nog in het tweede jaar terug te komen, nu en dan, maar dan toch altijd onregelmatig, ongeregistreerd. Groot is en blijft de aandrang van de ouders op 't regelmatig voortgezet toezicht, op den „verbindenden schakel\" met het schooltoezicht. „Een front is niet sterker dan zijn zwakste punt\", heeft onze pionier van de kleuterzorg Dr. C. M.MOL indertijd gezegd. Dit nu wordt aanzienlijk versterkt, de gaping wordt overbrugd. Eenzelfde toezicht, een zelfde deskundige als 't kan en waar dat nog niet kan, dan is daar toch altijd als blijvende waarde het begin van een „document humain\", een „carnet sanitaire\", dat kan worden meegedragen, uitgewisseld, geraadpleegd.

Hiernaast treedt de mogelijkheid van besmetting vóór de geboorte ver op den achtergrond; aan een zekere erfelijke dispositie kan slechts een zeer ondergeschikte rol worden toebedeeld. Ook de gevolgen van zulk een besmetting zijn buitengewoon funest; hoe jonger het kind, des te erger.

      "abstractNote": "Science in Transition, which started in 2013, is a small-scale Dutch initiative that presented a systems approach, comprised of analyses and suggested actions, based on experience in academia. It was built on writings by early science watchers and most recent theoretical developments in philosophy, history and sociology of science and STS on the practice and politics of science. This chapter will include my personal experiences as one of the four Dutch founders of Science in Transition. I will discuss the message and the various forms of reception over the past 6 years by the different actors in the field, including administrators in university, academic societies and Ministries of Higher Education, Economic Affairs and Public Health but also from leadership in the private sector. I will report on my personal experience of how these myths and ideologies play out in the daily practice of 40 years of biomedical research in policy and decision making in lab meetings, at departments, at grant review committees of funders and in the Board rooms and the rooms of Deans, Vice Chancellors and Rectors.It has in the previous chapters become clear that the ideology and ideals that we are brought up with are not valid, are not practiced despite that even in 2020 they are still somehow ‘believed’ by most scientists and even by many science watchers, journalists and used in political correct rhetoric and policy making by science’s leadership. In that way these ideologies and beliefs mostly implicitly but sometimes even explicitly determine debates regarding the internal policy of science and science policy in the public arena. These include all time classic themes like the uniqueness of science compared to any other societal activity; ethical superiority of science and scientists based on Mertonian norms; the vocational disinterested search for truth, autonomy; values and moral (political) neutrality, dominance of internal epistemic values and unpredictability regards impact. These ideas have influenced debates about the ideal and hegemony of natural science, the hierarchy of basic over applied science; theoretical over technological research and at a higher level in academic institutions and at the funders the widely held supremacy of STEM over SSH. This has directly determined the attitudes of scientists in the interaction with peers within the field, but also shaped the politics of science within science but also with policy makers and stakeholders from the public and private sector and with interactions with popular media.Science it was concluded was suboptimal because of growing problems with the quality and reproducibility of its published products due to failing quality control at several levels. Because of too little interactions with society during the phases of agenda setting and the actual process of knowledge production, its societal impact was limited which also relates to the lack of inclusiveness, multidisciplinarity and diversity in academia. Production of robust and significant results aiming at real world problems are mainly secondary to academic output relevant for an internally driven incentive and reward system steering for academic career advancement at the individual level. Similarly, at the higher organizational and national level this reward system is skewed to types of output and impact focused on positions on international ranking lists. This incentive and reward system, with flawed use of metrics, drives a hyper-competitive social system in academia which results in a widely felt lack of alignment and little shared value in the academic community. Empirical data, most of it from within science and academia, showing these problems in different academic disciplines, countries and continents are published on virtually a weekly basis since 2014. These critiques focus on the practices of scholarly publishing including Open Access and open data, the adverse effects of the incentive and reward system, in particular its flawed use of metrics. Images, ideologies and politics of science were exposed that insulate academia and science from society and its stakeholders, which distort the research agenda and subsequentially its societal and economic impact.",

      "abstractNote": "This essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing, with special attention to the example of Elsevier. A scholarly publisher can be defined as a surveillance publisher if it derives a substantial proportion of its revenue from prediction products, fueled by data extracted from researcher behavior. The essay begins by tracing the Google search engine’s roots in bibliometrics, alongside a history of the citation analysis company that became, in 2016, Clarivate. The point is to show the co-evolution of scholarly communication and the surveillance advertising economy. The essay then refines the idea of surveillance publishing by engaging with the work of Shoshana Zuboff, Jathan Sadowski, Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, and Aziz Huq. The recent history of Elsevier is traced to describe the company’s research-lifecycle data-harvesting strategy, with the aim to develop and sell prediction products to universities and other customers. The essay concludes by considering some of the potential costs of surveillance publishing, as other big commercial publishers increasingly enter the predictive-analytics mark. It is likely, I argue, that windfall subscription-and-APC profits in Elsevier’s “legacy” publishing business have financed its decade-long acquisition binge in analytics, with the implication that university customers are budgetary victims twice over. The products’ purpose, I stress, is to streamline the top-down assessment and evaluation practices that have taken hold in recent decades, in tandem with the view that the university’s main purpose is to grow regional and national economies. A final pair of concerns is that publishers’ prediction projects may camouflage and perpetuate existing biases in the system—and that scholars may internalize an analytics mindset, one already encouraged by citation counts and impact factors.",

      "abstractNote": "Nineteenth-century medical advances were entwined with a conceptual innovation: the idea that many cases of disease which were previously thought to have diverse causes could be explained by the action of a single kind of cause, for example a certain bacterial or parasitic infestation. The focus of modern epidemiology, however, is on chronic non-communicable diseases, which frequently do not seem to be attributable to any single causal factor. This paper is an effort to resolve the resulting tension. The paper criticises the monocausal model of disease, so successful in the nineteenth century. It also argues that a multifactorial model of disease can only be satisfactory if it amounts to more than a mere rejection of the monocausal model. A third alternative, the contrastive model, is proposed and defended on the grounds that it links the notions of disease and of general explanation, while avoiding the philosophical naiveties and practical difficulties of the monocausal model.",

      "abstractNote": "In this article, the author discusses plans that were launched at three consecutive conferences on care for toddlers between 1929 and 1938 in the Netherlands. These plans and their realisation are evaluated in terms of what was seen as the missing link in the supply of institutional care for young children. The author identifies the professional forces and their concerns, as well as their chosen techniques and cognitive forms. The “discovery” of toddlers’ “special” needs was initially inspired by paediatricians’ concern about the relatively high mortality and morbidity rates of children aged one to six. An age-specific hygienic shield was created, which produced graphs and charts and consequently, the normal child. During the 1930s, when toddlers’ physical health improved rapidly, a shift toward mental health and development became manifest. Developmentalism and psychoanalysis inspired a concern for this age as one of crisis and risk. Therefore, prevention of neuroses was now presented as a major challenge for professionals in toddlers’ welfare centres, health colonies, and nursery schools, who were supposed to best understand young children’s needs. One of the consequences was that, unlike in the post-war years, experts became convinced that small children were better off in institutions than at home.",

The argument can be made that there is a core of stability—perhaps something about the handle, the lever and the valve is invariant, together with the fact that it produces water. Alternatively it can be argued that there is not a core of stability (this is de Laet and Mol’s own suggestion). But this does not really matter, because much more important is the general fluidity of the relations that make up the pump. Here de Laet and Mol make their argument carefully. This general fluidity, they are saying, means that it should be seen as a fluid object.

      "abstractNote": "Few concepts played a more important role in twentieth-century life sciences than that of the gene. Yet at this moment, the field of genetics is undergoing radical conceptual transformation, and some scientists are questioning the very usefulness of the concept of the gene, arguing instead for more systemic perspectives.  The time could not be better, therefore, for Hans-Jörg Rheinberger and Staffan Müller-Wille's magisterial history of the concept of the gene. Though the gene has long been the central organizing theme of biology, both conceptually and as an object of study, Rheinberger and Müller-Wille conclude that we have never even had a universally accepted, stable definition of it. Rather, the concept has been in continual flux—a state that, they contend, is typical of historically important and productive scientific concepts. It is that very openness to change and manipulation, the authors argue, that made it so useful: its very mutability enabled it to be useful while the technologies and approaches used to study and theorize about it changed dramatically.",

      "abstractNote": "This article examines the sociotechnical imaginary within which contemporary biometric listening or VIA (voice identification and analysis) technologies are being developed. Starting from an examination of a key article on Voiceprint identification written in the 1940s, I interrogate the conceptual link between voice, body, and identity, which was central to these early attempts at technologizing voice identification. By surveying patents that delineate systems for voice identification, collection methods for voice data, and voice analysis, I find that the VIA industry is dependent on the conceptual affixion of voice to identity based on a reduction of voice that sees it as a fixed, extractable, and measurable ‘sound object’ located within the body. This informs the thinking of developers in the VIA industry, resulting in a reframing of the technological shortcomings of voice identification under the rubric of big data. Ultimately, this reframing rationalizes the implementation of audio surveillance systems into existing telecommunications infrastructures through which voice data is acquired on a massive scale.",

      "abstractNote": "This article presents a long overdue analysis of the idea of an ethically committed social science, which, after the demise of positivism and the deeming of moral neutrality as impossible, has come to dominate the self-understanding of many contemporary sociological approaches. Once adequately specified, however, the idea is shown to be ethically questionable in that it works against the moral commitments constitutive of academic life. The argument is conducted with resources from the work of Peter Winch, thus establishing its continuing relevance and critical importance for the social sciences, sociology in particular. Special reference is made to heretofore unappreciated aspects of Winch’s work, including within the groundbreaking The Idea of a Social Science and Its Relation to Philosophy, but focusing specifically on his later contributions to ethics.",

      "abstractNote": "This landscape analysis was produced by SPARC in response to the growing trend of commercial acquisition of critical infrastructure in our institutions. It is intended to provide a comprehensive look at the current players in this arena, their strategies and potential actions, and the implications of these on the operations of our libraries and home institutions. It also outlines suggestions for an initial set of strategic responses for the community to evaluate in order to ensure it controls both this infrastructure and the data generated by/resident on it. We are at a critical juncture where there is a pressing need for the academic community – individually and collectively – to make thoughtful and deliberate decisions about what and whom to support – and under what terms and conditions. These decisions will determine who ultimately controls the research and education process; and whether we meaningfully address inequities created by legacy players or simply recreate them in new ways. These decisions will shape libraries’ role in the scholarly enterprise, now and for the future.",

      "abstractNote": "Collectivist versus individualistic values are important attributes of intercultural variation. Collectivist values favour in-group members over out-group members and may have evolved to protect in-group members against pathogen transmission. As predicted by the pathogen stress theory of cultural values, more collectivist countries are associated with a higher historical pathogen burden. However, if lifestyles of collectivist countries indeed function as a social defence which decreases pathogen transmission, then these countries should also have experienced fewer disease outbreaks in recent times. We tested this novel hypothesis by correlating the values of collectivism-individualism for 66 countries against their historical pathogen burden, recent number of infectious disease outbreaks and zoonotic disease outbreaks and emerging infectious disease events, and four potentially confounding variables. We confirmed the previously established negative relationship between individualism and historical pathogen burden with new data. While we did not find a correlation for emerging infectious disease events, we found significant positive correlations between individualism and the number of infectious disease outbreaks and zoonotic disease outbreaks. Therefore, one possible cost for individualistic cultures may be their higher susceptibility to disease outbreaks. We support further studies into the exact protective behaviours and mechanisms of collectivist societies which may inhibit disease outbreaks.",

      "abstractNote": "Collective intentionality is the power of minds to be jointly directedat objects, matters of fact, states of affairs, goals, or values.Collective intentionality comes in a variety of modes, includingshared intention, joint attention, shared belief, collectiveacceptance, and collective emotion. Collective intentional attitudespermeate our everyday lives, for instance when two or more agents lookafter or raise a child, grieve the loss of a loved one, campaign for apolitical party, or cheer for a sports team. They are relevant forphilosophers and social scientists because they play crucial roles inthe constitution of the social world. In joint attention, theworld is experienced as perceptually available for a plurality ofagents. This establishes a basic sense of common ground on which otheragents may be encountered as potential cooperators. Sharedintention enables the participants to act together intentionally,in a coordinated and cooperative fashion, and to achieve collectivegoals. The capacity for shared belief provides us with a common stockof knowledge, and thus with a background against which relevant newinformation which we may want to share with others becomes salient.Collective acceptance is crucial for the development oflanguage, and for a whole world of symbols, institutions, and socialstatus. Collective emotions provide us with a sharedconception of what matters to us, together, and they establishreadiness for joint action. In virtue of capacity for collectiveintentionality, we can (and should) engage in joint reasoning anddeliberation, and (re-)organize ourselves to make sure that the way welive together is how we, collectively, want it to be, from oursmall-scale communities to global politics., Collective intentional attitudes involve a plurality of participantsin such a way that the attitudes in question can be ascribed toindividuals as a group, or unit. The main philosophicalchallenge connected with the analysis of collective intentionality isin the tension within the expression “individuals as agroup”. It can be spelled out as a contradiction between thefollowing two widely accepted claims (the Central Problem): , Over the last couple of decades, a number of theories of collectiveintentionality have been proposed, pointing towards different ways tosolve this tension.",

      "abstractNote": "It was only around 1800 that heredity began to enter debates among physicians, breeders, and naturalists. Soon thereafter it evolved into one of the most fundamental concepts of biology. Here Staffan Müller-Wille and Hans-Jörg Rheinberger offer a succinct cultural history of the scientific concept of heredity. They outline the dramatic changes the idea has undergone since the early modern period and describe the political and technological developments that brought about these changes.  Müller-Wille and Rheinberger begin with an account of premodern theories of generation, showing that these were concerned with the procreation of individuals rather than with hereditary transmission. The authors reveal that when hereditarian thinking first emerged, it did so in a variety of cultural domains, such as politics and law, medicine, natural history, breeding, and anthropology. Müller-Wille and Rheinberger then track theories of heredity from the late nineteenth century—when leading biologists considered it in light of growing societal concerns with race and eugenics—through the rise of classical and molecular genetics in the twentieth century, to today, as researchers apply sophisticated information technologies to understand heredity. What readers come to see from this exquisite history is why it took such a long time for heredity to become a prominent concept in the life sciences and why it gained such overwhelming importance in those sciences and the broader culture over the last two centuries.",

It is interesting that J.H.G. Carstens (at the age of 24 - later one of the founders of the Utrechtse Vereeniging tot Bescherming van de zuigelingen) was one of the new school physicians . Interesting that Christian school did not participate because ‘parents took care’ or school physicians was ‘for the poor. <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2243%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 43</span>)</span></p>\n<p>[chapter 5]</p>\n<p>School physicians in Utrecht were very busy, and worked reactively and proactively. Most of the time they sent children home or to a specialist. In case of an infectious disease, the school physicians visited homes proactively to check whether advise had been followed <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2245%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 45</span>)</span>.</p>\n<p>Fascinating that Carstens started to organise school physicians on a national level, according to ‘t Hart because of the lacking expertise. He founded the “Nederlandsche Vereeniging voor Schoolartsen”, which was the reason for acknowledging school physicians as a sociaal-medical specialisation <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2247%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 47</span>)</span>.</p>\n<p>‘T Hart mentions that school physicians became more effective when the municipality informed them when infectious diseases were found in specific families. School physicians also played an important role in pleading for funding for local civil initiatives that, for example, offered gymnastic excersice for poor children with scoliosis. <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2247%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 47</span>)</span></p>\n<p>In 1915, the utrecht GG&amp;GD was centralised under the direction of 6 municipal physicians. the city was divided in three areas, and two municiapl physicians were responsible for one area. They were responsible for school inspection, medical help for the poor, and inspection the labour force of the municiaplity. They were located in three communitiy building on the border of two area’s: at the Radiumstraat, the Wittevrouwensingel, and the Oosterkade. ‘T Hart interestingly shows that now the municipality physicians could both inspect children at school and check without “bureaucratic hassle” whether advise was followed under two different hats. For this period, this centralisation was very different as compared to other cities. <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2248%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 48</span>)</span></p>\n<p>Also from 1918, the municipal physicians were assisted by school nurses, who also visited neighbourhoods to control whether adivise was followed <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2252%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 52</span>)</span></p>\n<p>It is also interesing that general practitioners were afraid of competition, and framed their criticism as fear for interferance in family life <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2252%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 52</span>)</span>.</p>\n<p>[Chapter 7]</p>\n<p>‘t Hart sketches the response to most infectious diseases. The GG&amp;GD played an important role in campaigns against diphtheria, it does not become clear what role school physicians played in inocculation <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2259%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 59</span>)</span>. In the 1920s and 1930s, school nurses visited children at home to investigate “inform” families about what to do against head lice. Later in 1941, it was mandatory to cut hair of children with head lice - measure was withdrawn after WWII. <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2265%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 65</span>)</span></p>\n<p>[Chapter 8]</p>\n<p>‘T Hart gets a bit more sloppy in his sketchy descriptions. He shows how “vakantiekolonies”, “kinderuitzettingen” etc. were important facet of child health interventions, and part of the dynamics of civil society, with a (minor) funding municiaplity, who tried to coordinate activities by forcing overarching organisations (such as URK - “Utrechtse Raad voor Kinderuitzetting” in 1924) to coordinate collaboration. ‘t Hart has a lot of attention for “Paascheizakjes” in 1936 and later. He argues that medical professionals were used for selecting eligibility for deploying to “vakantiekoloniën” and that school physicians played a central rol, next to GP’s. Also interesitng is that ‘t Hart argues that these deploying activities disappeared due to WWII conditions, and more fully during the 1970s as a result of better socioeconomic living conditions. <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2273-75%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, pp. 73-75</span>)</span></p>\n<p>‘t Hart now descibed budget cuts, and the constant necessity for the GG&amp;GD and school physicians (after the WWII, this division does not really make sense) to account for their expenses. It is fascinating that - apparently - in the 1970s and 1980s GG&amp;GDs were asked to scrimp <em>because</em> of the existence of infant care:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Was er wel een schoolarts nodig om vast te stellen dat een kind gezwollen tonsillen had of een hoge bloeddruk? Dankzij de uitgebreide zorg voor zuigelingen en kleuters (door kruisverenigingen, huisartsen en gezondheidscentra), werden ergelijke en grove afwijkingen al ontdekt en aangepakt voordat de kinderen naar school gingen. Wat had dan de ingangscontrole en een incidenteel bezoek van een schoolarts voor zin? In 1975 reageerde de GG&amp;GD op zulke vragen onder met de verzekering: <em>“Jeugdgezondheidzorg is een veelomvattend medische specialisme waarvoor gericht getrainde artsen, verpleegkunidgen, en medisch administatieve medewerkers moeten worden ingezet.”</em> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2277%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 77</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[chapter 9]</p>\n<p>This chapter is a rather eclectic reflection on the - at the time - current status of child health intervention. It touches on the necessity of collaboration on the level of the neighbourhood; the introduction of sexual health; the problems arising from raising children in an intercultural setting. On the side, ‘t Hart indicates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zo is toch gebeurd wat sommigen inm het verleden vreesden: de jeugdarts draagt met zijn medewerkers normen en waarden uit en mengt zich in gezinsaangelegenhede <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2289%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 89</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also interesting that ‘t Hart observes that child abuse was not a part of child health intervention. It was “not mentioned in 1905” and in 1970s, “only one in 10.00 children was registered as abused” <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2290%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 90</span>)</span>. Is this true?</p>\n<p>‘t Hart indicates that one questions remains relevant for the whole period, and it is an interesting one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eén probleem is onveranderd gebleven: waar moeten het geld en de mensen worden gevonden voor het werk en voor het overleg met al die gesprekspartners? <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22locator%22%3A%2292%22%2C%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FNWCR6BHL%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hart, 1999, p. 92</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

      "abstractNote": "The introduction of performance-related pay into universities in recent years implies a belief that academic behaviours are modified by money. However, many valued academic activities are poorly paid or not paid at all. Clearly other factors are at work. Academic motivation and new working patterns are explored using the literature. An anthropological term ‘prestige economy’ is defined and located as part of a three-part model, and its application to higher education is explored, using a socio-cultural approach rooted in Bourdieu’s analyses of academic life. The implications for those who seek to bring about change in institutions are considered and further research questions outlined.",

      "abstractNote": "The history of eugenics has been one of the most dynamic and challenging areas within the history of biology offering critical new perspectives in modern social history. Eugenics offered modern, scientifically based “solutions” to crime, poverty, and social deviancy. The eugenics discourse became complex with diverse positions on the questions of race, birth control entitlement, and welfare benefits. From a methodological point of view, discourse risks ignoring how context and social processes shape meaning, overlooks issues of impact, and can amount to little more than an old-fashioned narrative of intellectual progress. One challenge is to look beyond discourse to such social processes as professionalization and the construction of welfare institutions and practices. Eugenics provides insight into wider social transformations showing how science represented differing social agendas.",

      "abstractNote": "The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) was penned 5 years ago to articulate best practices for how we communicate and judge our scientific contributions. In particular, it adamantly declared that Journal Impact Factor (JIF) should never be used as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research contributions, or for hiring, promotion, or funding decisions. Since then, a heightened awareness of the damaging practice of using JIFs as a proxy for the quality of individual papers, and to assess an individual’s or institution’s accomplishments has led to changes in policy and the design and application of best practices to more accurately assess the quality and impact of our research. Herein I summarize the considerable progress made and remaining challenges that must be met to ensure a fair and meritocratic approach to research assessment and the advancement of research.",

Huige takes conclusion that science was not a solely national matter. [[BPB Plantenga]] founded the first one in the Hague in 1901 with a [[melkkeuken]]. Apparently, [[In the 1910s, consultation offices received a lot of criticism as result from the general scepticism of preventive medicine.]]</p>\n<p>[[The expanding number of consultation offices went hand in hand with the proffesionalisation of social medicine]]. In 1921, the [[Nederlandsche Vereniging voor de Kindergeneeskunde]] and the [[Nederlandsche Bond zuigelingen tot Bescherming van Zuigelingen]] who required consultation offices to have a specialist-doctor leading the [[Consultatiebureau]]. As a result, they were organised by [[districtshuisberzoekster]] and physician. [[Before WW2, the Netherlands knew a closed network of consultation offices]].</p>\n<p>## 7.2 Het werk van de consultatiebureau en de bureaumedewerkers</p>\n<p>The enormous [[naoorlogse babyboom]] steered activities on preventive child health care, it also launched an enormous amount of literature on the pedagogical aspects of raising children. [[M.J. Langeveld]] was one of its most activie propagators.</p>\n<p>Cross societies apparantly formed internal [[wijkgebouwencommissies]] in response to the primitive situation of some consultation office. In those place with modern facilitities, in the 1950s, a [[Consultatiebureau]] included [[Wachtkamer]] [[weegbureau]] and [[spreekkamer]]. [[After the world wars, cross societies actively claimed the decline of child mortality as victory resulting from their preventive activities.]]</p>\n<p>[[Consultatiebureaus voor Kleuters]] started in the 1950s, but stayed behind in the number of consults. It also becomes clear that [[In the first half of the 20th century (but maybe even later), general practitioners organised a consultation bureau on their own initiative.]] In general, [[The differences between consultation offices were very sky high, as care was organised ad-hoc.]]</p>\n<p>TYPES OF ADVICE</p>\n<p>[[During the 1950s and 1960s, new pioneers started to shift priorities in child health care and create standardised and uniform procedures.]] Relates to [[In the 1970s, examanination was 'hardened' and standardised.]] [[Suze van Veen]] &nbsp;paved the way for talking about [[somatisch-psychosociale problematiek]]. [[J.H. de Haas]] took care for national registration system. [[In the early 1960s, growth curves were introduced.]] [[With the introduction of standardised indicators resulted in translating uncertainty into normalised certainty.]]</p>\n<p>TASKS</p>\n<p>In 1921, it had been decided that [[wijkverpleegkundigen]] and physicians had to work together in a hierarchical manner. Nevertheless, [[huisbezoeken]] by [[districtshuisberzoekster]] were important elements in succes. Apparently, [[in the first half of the 20th century, district nurses recieved updates from maternatiy nurses.]]</p>\n<p>Within consultation offices, the physician inspected the baby while the nurse visited mothers at home and checked whether advise was followed on a proactive basis. [[The privacy of mothers could play a role in evaluating district nursing and the efficacy of consultation offices.]] (p278). [[districtshuisberzoekster]] should therefore be a good listener. According to Huige: [[District nursing from consultation offices was not abolished because of privacy concerns, but because of outbalanced labour intensity.]] Later, [[districtshuisberzoekster]] were used to perform the [[Hielprik]]</p>\n<p>PRENATAL AND TODDLERS</p>\n<p>[[Prenatale consultatiebureaus]] had been initiated in the first half of the twentieth century, but they were all closed in the 1950s, due to a lack of interest. [[The initiation of consultation offices for toddlers went hand in hand with the focus on mental and more holistic conception of health.]] [[Consultatiebureaus voor Kleuters]] ceased to exist in the 1960s. Several reasons played a role:</p>\n<p>- Meassurable succes of diagnosing[[somatisch-psychosociale problematiek]]</p>\n<p>- [[specialisation]] of peadiatrics</p>\n<p>- the initiation of [[Pedagogisch Consultatiebureau]] (&lt;- though these could also not elevate the success of normal the [[Consultatiebureau]])</p>\n<p>Also interesting that Huige lies the connection with [[maakbaarheid van de samenleving]] and the impopularity of [[Prenatale consultatiebureaus]] and [[Consultatiebureaus voor Kleuters]]:</p>\n<p>&gt; Hoe de ordening van de hulpverlinbgn daarop inbgericht moest worden was echter niet duidelijk, en binnen die context moesten de kleuterbureaus hun weg maar zein te vinden. Bovendien was in het begin van de jaren zestig no een sterk geloog in de maakbare samenleving aanwezig, en werd de indruk gewekt dat met een beetje inschikken begrip voor elkaar en zo nodig corrigende optreden het aards paradijs hier op aarde gecreerd kon worden</p>\n<p>#### De periode 1966-1990</p>\n<p>Huige observes a mentality change during the 1960s: [[During the 1960s, a shifting mentality with less emphasis on authority and paternalism in public and academic discourse, the organisation and procedural ways of working shifted.]] This can apparently be observed in the difference between the work of [[M.J. Langeveld]] shortly after WW2 and that of [[M. van Blankenstein]]. Apparently, this transition went hand in hand with professionalisation and [[In the 1970s, examanination was 'hardened' and standardised.]] [[Child health intervention took shape in education of mothers and professionalisation of child health care.]] Together with the introduction of [[Gezondheidsvoorlichting- en Opvoedings (GVO)]] profesionals.</p>\n<p>[[The dependent relationship between professional physicians and the cross societies became increasingly problematised during the 1970s]] different reports occured in which the organisation and priorities of the consultation bureaus was re-imagined. One of the most important reason was the underpaid position of physicians working at consultation bureaus, often because of their loyalty. The re-imagined organisation structure and priorities of consultation offices went hand in hand with the introduction of [[jeugdverpleegkundigen]] as substitutes for [[wijkverpleegkundigen]]</p>\n<p>The tension between [[Specifieke Zusters]] and [[Polyvalente Zusters]] was important in the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed [[District nursing from consultation offices was not abolished because of privacy concerns, but because of outbalanced labour intensity.]] in the 1970s, this also seen as settling the debate. According to Huige, however, the development went in the direction of [[specialisation]]; not of all round care. The Utrecht case shows, however, that the [[Utrechtsche Vereniging tot Berscherming van de Zuigelingen]] lost territory and even its very existence as result of the dispute at the cost of allround care in the rest of the city. [[In the 1960s and 1970s, the division of labour within consultation offices was a central topic of discussion.]] </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[[In the 1970s, the changing Dutch social context and growing complecity also caused a shifting focus to psychosocial characteristics and normal development.]] Huige mentions economic decay, unemployment, changing values of family life, and growing number of immigrants as key developments. [[During the 1970s and 1980s, preventive care for young children was provided for different nationalities.]] Additionally, [[With the introduction of contraceptives in the 1970s, and families became smaller, parents had less experience with raising children. 1]] </p>\n<p>(pp296-288) To investigate these psychosocial characteristics as part of research to [[Vroegtijdige onderkenning van ontwikkelstoornissen (VTO)]], the [[Van Wiechen-ontwikkelingskaart]] was introduced. This was part of an initiative of [[H.J. van Wiechen]], to introduce the [[drieluik met dwarse groeicurve]] and based the initiative of [[J.P. Boekhold]] at the [[Federatieve Commissie voor Kinderhygiëne Zuid Holland]]. In 1983, the result of a [[werkgroep van Wiechen]] part of the [[Nationale Kruisvereniging (NK)]] made the [[Van Wiechen-ontwikkelingskaart]] part of [[dossier Jeugdgezondheidszorg]]. The [[WHO definition of Health]] also played an important role in legitimising this practice. The [[In the 1970s, examanination was 'hardened' and standardised.]] of consultation bureau care was associated with this development. Moreover, the shifting focus caused that [[In the 1980s, the differences between 'oude-'' and 'nieuwe stijl' consultation offices intensified.]] &nbsp;This contributed to the [[Longitudinale kinderzorg]] that started to get important in the 1980s. In sum, the standardisation of child health intervention in the 1970s and 1980s was a response to late recognition of predisposed diseases AND fitted the mentality of accounting and objectivity.</p>\n<p>One of the most active opponents of quantitative developmental investigation was [[Micha de Winter]], who celebrated a more [[systemische ontwikkelingsbenadering]] of child health in the 1980s and 1990s. He prosed a more [[systemische ontwikkelingsbenadering]]. [[During the 1980s and 1990, an academic debate between individual oriented and system oriented child health monitoring crystallised in an interactive model between nature and nurture.]] This resulted in attention for [[ouder-kindrelatie]] and [[Afdeling Ouder Kind Zorg (OKZ)]] in the 1980s. According to Huige (p292), the [[1980 Gewijzigde Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]], made the proactive attitude of cross work one of its core duties.</p>\n<p>One key -- and yet unanswered -- question remains the use and function of [[Consultatiebureaus voor Kleuters]], that still did not really succeeded in explaining its added value. According to Huige (p293): </p>\n<p>&gt; \"Gevraagd naar een oorzaak waarom de kleuterbureau veel minder uit de verf kwamen dan de zuigelingenbureaus, merken de deskundige op dat het grote verschil hem er vooral in zit dat een zuigeling nog zo klein en kwetsbaar is. Jonge ouders unnen daar oprecht bezorgd over maken en zijn dan zelf ook kwetsbaar. Als een peuter echter normaal opgroeit en zich ontwikkelt, dan is een hoge frequentie van consulten in feite niet langer nodig.\"</p>\n<p>This required more reflection. To me, it seems that [[Consultatiebureaus voor Kleuters]] did not really have a clear problem to solve. While consultation offices remained responding to uncertainties relating to child mortality and raising children. This was less clear in the case of toddlers. In other words, [[Kleuterconsultatiebureaus kept struggling to legitimise their added value because it remained unclear which problems they solved.]]</p>\n<p>Another topicular issue result from the [[1974 Wet op de gezinshereniging]] which had the result that [[From the 1970s and 1980s, immigrants created the struggle with cultural diversity in preventive child care.]] (Huige, p.294) It seems fascinating that, again steered by [[Micha de Winter]], this resulted in a discussion about social norms. One note is extremely interesting, Huige: \"In elk geval moet de consultatiebureaus voor de zuigelingen worden nagegeven dat zij er - getuige de hoge opkomstcijfers - in geslaagd zijn het vertrouwen te winnen van de niet-Westerse vroyuwen, net zoals dat in de eerste decennia van de vorige eeuw met Nederlandse moeders geschiedde.\" (p.293)</p>\n<p>## 7.3 Landelijke Ontwikkelingen</p>\n<p>Huige characterises the two first post war decades as calm and inspired by the growing disicpline of social medicine. It might be important to note that preventive child health intervention was funded to a provincial [[kinderarts]] and a [[districtshuisberzoekster]] who had a coordinating role in the 1950s and 1960s. Makes me think of [[C.J.W. Frijlink]] in Utrecht. Huige als mentions that [[After the WW2, the internationally renowed low child mortality was explained due to the success of consultation offices.]] Nevertheless, in the 1960s, the functioning of child health intervention through cross societies was questioned. [[Troughout the twentieth century, the disered expansion of child health intervention could not be met with the required money and manpower, resulting in the constant experience of work pressure.]] This is especially clear in the discussion about higher wages for consultation physicians - a debate mainly steered by the [[(Koninklijke) Nederlandse Maatschappij tot bevordering van de Geneeskunde (KNMG)]] and the [[Algemene Nederlandse Vereniging het Groene Kruis (ANV)]]. This debate was unsuccessful, as the responsible minister was unable to provide funding. What was interesting, though, was that [[meneer Dijkhuis]] and the [[Geneeskundige Hoofdinspectie voor de Volksgezondheid]] required local cross societies to rearange. According to Huige (p.297)</p>\n<p>&gt; De kritiek concentreerde zich vooral op de grote verschillen in benaderingswijzen tussen provincies onderling. In 1964 werd een eerste signaal afgegegevn toen in het Topkruizenberaad met het department uitvoerig gesproken werd over de voortgang van de kinderhygiëne in het land. Aanleiding was een door de [[Geneeskundige Hoofdinspectie voor de Volksgezondheid]] geschreven discussienota #todo over een gewenste reorganisatie van deze dienst. Tamelijk laconiek wezen de landelijke kruisverenigingen erop dat het door de inspectie voorgestane model eigenlijk al achterhaald was, omdat men op onderdelen al bezig was de organisaite aan te passen. Tegelijkertijd werd van de nood een deugd gemaakt door hieraan toe te voegen dat men niettemin met instemming kennis had genomen van de nota, omdat dit de gelegenehid boodnog eens te wijzen op de financi:ele problematiek waarmee consultatiebureaus kampten.</p>\n<p>( This is a great argument for [[Trought the twentieth century, local developments influenced national policies on public health.]] )</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, this chaotic situation continued: [[In the 1960s, from the perspective of cross societies, difficult times came because of the growing mingling from national governement and worries about payment and position of local physicians.]] The local physicians consisted out of [[vrijgevestigde huisartsen]], [[mevrouw-artsen]], an hired [[kinderarts]]. This was called the [[honoreringskwestie]]. It may be that this was primarily an issue in cities, as some [[vrijgevestigde huisartsen]] saw labour at consultation offices as a [[moral obligation]].</p>\n<p>[[Nationaal Centrum voor Kruiswerk (NCvK)]] formed as central lobby for keeping preventive child care part of cross societies. Especially since [[W van der Meeren]] wrote on behalf of [[Nederlandsche Bond zuigelingen tot Bescherming van Zuigelingen]] a report [[Nota Van der Meeren]] in which he concluded that preventive child care should be taken away from them. This was taken over from 1973 at the [[Ministerie voor Volksgezondheid en Milieuhygiëne]] in which policy makers questioned the necessity of consultation offices at all: [[Consultation Offices struggled in the early 1970s with problems of legitimacy]] Comparable to: [[The Amsterdam GGD suffered in the second half of the 20th century with problems of legitimacy.]] This went hand in hand with [[In the 1970s a growing emphasis on individual responsibility changed the way of working at consultation offices.]] According to Huige, however: (p301):</p>\n<p>&gt; ... het gedachtegoed van [[W van der Meeren]] om de consultatiebureaus bij de kruizen weg te haleb, bleek aanhang te hebben binnen de overheid. De sterke politieke lobby die de kruizen van oudsher onderhielden, voorkwamen erger, maar de decennialang onaantastbare positie van de kruizen op dit terrein kwam steeds meer op de tocht te staan.</p>\n<p>With the [[1980 Nota schets van beleid - basisgezondheidsdiensten]] by [[E. Veder-Smit]] , the policy recommendations of [[Nota Van der Meeren]] were continued. In response, the [[Centrale Raad voor de Volksgezondheid]] wrote a report in which they recommended \"teamverband en samenwerking met andere organisaties en stodne een meer gestandaardiseerde werkwijzew voor. Het werken in georganiseerd verband moest veel van de vrijblijvendheid bij de uitvoerende consultatiebureauartsen wegnemen. (p.300-1)\". Both [[vrijgevestigde huisartsen]], united trough the [[Landelijke Huisartsen Vereniging (LHV)]] and youth physicians disliked these recommendations. The report did lead to discussion about the organisation of preventive care for children.</p>\n<p>- On the one hand, [[Nederlands Instituut voor de Preventive Geneeskunde (TNO-NIPG)]] &nbsp;recommended to harmonize all [[Longitudinale kinderzorg]] through [[ontschotting]]. With the [[1980 Gewijzigde Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]], secretary [[E. Veder-Smit]] had the opportunity to interfer top-down. [[Preventice child care by cross societies was continuously accused of having a non-committal nature.]] This was called the [[samenhangingsprobleem]] and connected to [[Longitudinale kinderzorg]] based on integral epidemiological reasoning.</p>\n<p>- On the other hand, the [[Nationale Kruisvereniging (NK)]] identified two main problems, resulting from that [[Troughtout the 20th century, whereas care at consultation offices was initially focussed on growth and nutrition, focus shifted towards early recognition of developmental deficits.]] This [[Gezondheidsvoorlichting- en Opvoedings (GVO)]] lied new accents. The most important was the initially independent position of youth physicians, the idea to hire these by cross societies, did not really work.</p>\n<p>The result was a quarrel between [[Landelijke Huisartsen Vereniging (LHV)]] and the [[Nationale Kruisvereniging (NK)]] about the labour relation between consultation offices and general physicians. After years of negotiating, at January 12 1983, an agreement was reached to pay general practitioners 69 gulden per hour, to participate in consultation offices ran by the cross societies. Interestingly, one of the requirements of the cross socities was the GP's to have a \"preventive mindset\" (Huige, 306). The dispute was further thought through at the conference \"het consultatiebureau is niet van gisteren\" in 1988, in which the lack of vision of [[Wisse Dekker]] on prevention. [[E. Veder-Smit]], now chair of the [[Nationale Kruisvereniging (NK)]], emphasised the importance of consultation offices, by [[Vroegtijdige onderkenning van ontwikkelstoornissen (VTO)]] and [[From the 1970s and 1980s, immigrants created the struggle with cultural diversity in preventive child care.]]. A way to legitimise the need for consultation offices was by competing with affordable pricing, was one of the arguments.</p>\n<p>Summarized, the following issues made preventive child care a difficult political topic:</p>\n<p>- [[During the 1980s, cross societies sturggled to collaborate with general practitioners.]]</p>\n<p>- [[During the 1980s, cross societies were at risk of losing preventive child care to municipal health services.]]</p>\n<p>- [[During the 1980s, market values threatened the funding of consultation offices.]]</p>\n<p>- [[During the 1980s, debates on the nature of expertise and training of consultation office employees was continuously debated.]]</p>\n<p>This context set the stage for political debates on the organisation of and responsibility for preventive care for young children. The debate on the [[1989 wet collectieve preventie Volksgezondheid]] was the final challenge for keeping preventive child care within the domain of cross socities. It is interesting that, [[At the end of the 1980, cross societies themselves did not do whatever imaginable to keep preventive child care aboard.]] [[At the end of the 1980s, cross societies started focussing on the elderly at the cost of young children.]]</p>\n<p>## 7.4 Deskundigheidsbevordering, opleiding</p>\n<p>In general, the education for physicians with respect to consultation office work, did merely exist until the early 1980s. In 1981, only 16 of the 2000 physicians working in a consultation office were registered as social medicine professionals. (Huige, 311). [[Professionalised training of child health professionals started around the 1970s.]]</p>\n<p>After WW2, a genertaion of consultation office employees was trained by \"[[De Koppius]]\", written bij [[Paul Wibo Koppius]]. Sold from 1957. Intended for both nurses and practitioners, with the result that pathologie played either to big of a role or too small. In 1962, jeugdgezondheidszorg was recognised as official specialism by the [[(Koninklijke) Nederlandse Maatschappij tot bevordering van de Geneeskunde (KNMG)]]. It is interesting that even though consultation offices were part of social medicine, they did not openly participate in national debates (according to huige p.312) in the first decades after WW2.</p>\n<p>The confrontation with different cultures and attention for [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]] made the necessity for knowledge sharing important. The [[Tijdschrift voor Jeugdgezondheidzorg]], founded in 1969 in Zuid-Holland was a first step into this direction. As a result, [[During the 1970s, the meaning and implications of physicial health were strongly contested.]] In response, the [[Nationale Kruisvereniging (NK)]] made a 1977 report that can be seen as the starting point of [[consultatiebureau nieuwe stijl]], in which [[districtshuisberzoekster]] gained a more prominent role. Physicians, on their turn, were required to specialise in epidemiology, as well as [[mental health]]. [[In the 1980s, the differences between 'oude-'' and 'nieuwe stijl' consultation offices intensified.]]</p>\n<p>In 1978, the first post graduate course on child hygiene (kinderhygiene) was taking place. In 1983, this course became past of Post Academische Onderwijs Geneeskunde [[Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam]]. The [[Ministerie voor Volksgezondheid en Milieuhygiëne]] and [[Nationale Kruisvereniging (NK)]] organised and coordinated this application courses in the 1980, but this organisation was not quite professional.</p>\n<p>## 7.5 Terugblik, de situatie 1990</p>\n<p>- [[Standardisation in the 1970s was a response to crises of legitimacy of preventice child care.]]</p>\n<p>- [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]]</p>\n<p>\t- Transition from [[Rust, Reinheid, Regelmaat]], to \"Recht, ruimte, respect\" (&lt; [[Micha de Winter]])</p>\n<p>- [[From the 1970s the parental voice became increasingly important in consultation offices.]] Also had to do with [[With the introduction of contraceptives in the 1970s, and families became smaller, parents had less experience with raising children. 1]].</p>\n<p>- [[Professionalised training of child health professionals started around the 1970s.]]</p>\n<p>- [[Consultation offices were primarily succesful in offering certainty to mothers; not necessarily in cuasing health benefits]] </p>\n<p>- [[In the 1970s, the amphasis on longitudinal care went hand in hand with pleas for preventive child health under one organisation.]]</p>\n</div>",

      "abstractNote": "The time-honored mechanism of allocating funds based on ranking of proposals by scientiﬁc peer review is no longer effective, because review panels cannot accurately stratify proposals to identify the most meritorious ones. Bias has a major inﬂuence on funding decisions, and the impact of reviewer bias is magniﬁed by low funding paylines. Despite more than a decade of funding crisis, there has been no fundamental reform in the mechanism for funding research. This essay explores the idea of awarding research funds on the basis of a modiﬁed lottery in which peer review is used to identify the most meritorious proposals, from which funded applications are selected by lottery. We suggest that a modiﬁed lottery for research fund allocation would have many advantages over the current system, including reducing bias and improving grantee diversity with regard to seniority, race, and gender.",

In hun kritiek twijfelen zij niet al­ leen aan de doelmatigheid van dit soort voorzie­ ningen, maar kenschetsen sommige effecten van deze verzorgingsarrangementen ronduit als negatief. Volgens hen heeft professionele hulp en zorg de autonomie .van patiënten en cliënten doen afnemen. Ouders zijn bijvoorbeeld voor de verzorging van hun kinderen afhankelijk geworden van overheid en gespecialiseerde beroepskringen. De pogingen van beroepsspecialisten om het gezinsleven beter van kwaliteit en huiselijker te maken, hebben juist afbreuk gedaan aan het vermogen van deze gezinnen om te fungeren als een veilig toevluchtsoord.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22462%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Daalen, 1981, p. 462</span>)</span> Oke, this is the full blown Foucauldian argument that consultation offices compromises the autonomy of parents</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FBW6GYFFK%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22ULDSNHP7%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22462%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B26.4%2C199.826%2C327.152%2C208.236%5D%2C%5B26.4%2C189.026%2C339.899%2C197.436%5D%2C%5B26.4%2C178.226%2C326.952%2C186.636%5D%2C%5B27.4%2C167.726%2C333.255%2C176.136%5D%2C%5B26.1%2C156.926%2C334.853%2C165.336%5D%2C%5B26.4%2C146.126%2C347.354%2C154.536%5D%2C%5B27.1%2C135.326%2C345.849%2C143.736%5D%2C%5B25.9%2C124.526%2C53.599%2C132.936%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22462%22%7D%7D\">“dit artikel, waarbij de nadruk zal liggen op de ontstaansgeschiedenis van de zuigelingenzorg - op de verstatelijking én op de medicalisering - en zal worden beschreven welke groepen gebaat waren bij de instituering van gemeentelijke geneeskun­ dige consultatiebureau's en van welke maatschappe­ lijke ontwikkelingen deze instituering afhankelijk was.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22462%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Daalen, 1981, p. 462</span>)</span> The article is proconceived and misleading, because it presumes what it tries to prove.

De sterfte onder kinderen die kunstmatig gevoed werden was vele malen groter dan onder kinderen die gezoogd werden (13). Dit gold vooral voor de arme bevolking, die niet in staat was om de toch al schaarse alterna­ tieven voor moedermelk te bekostigen en die bij de bereiding van kunstvoeding met gebrekkige hygiëni­ sche voorzieningen te kampen had. Op grond van deze gegevens bepleitten artsen, dat de bestrij­ ding van de zuigelingensterfte in de eerste plaats in het teken van het bevorderen van de borstvoe­ ding moest staan. Zij gingen ervan uit, dat moe­ ders het zogen niet op waarde wisten te schatten en dat ze het daarom vaak nalieten. Door voor­ lichting en controle zou daarin verandering ge­ bracht moeten worden. Het \"zuigelingenprobleem\" zou daarom door medisch deskundigen - artsen en verpleegsters - in samenwerking met moeders moeten worden opgelost.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22467%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Daalen, 1981, p. 467</span>)</span> Infant mortality &gt; bad nutrition (milk) &gt; socioeconomic position &gt; information/consultation/surveillance on breastfeeding as a solution.</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FBW6GYFFK%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%225VJF4XV6%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22467%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B46.3%2C175.123%2C361.801%2C182.28%5D%2C%5B47.8%2C164.523%2C83.95%2C171.68%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22467%22%7D%7D\">“Het belang van melk voor de gezondheid van zuigeZingen”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22467%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Daalen, 1981, p. 467</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FBW6GYFFK%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22PZBKVIA7%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22468%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B28.1%2C91.126%2C341.105%2C99.536%5D%2C%5B28.1%2C80.526%2C340.097%2C88.936%5D%2C%5B28.1%2C69.726%2C347.605%2C78.136%5D%2C%5B27.8%2C58.926%2C335.104%2C67.336%5D%2C%5B27.1%2C48.126%2C333.501%2C56.536%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22468%22%7D%7D\">“In Amsterdam was vanaf de tweede helft van de ne­gentiende eeuw sprake van een gemeentelijk beleid tot verbetering van de melkvoorziening, als onder­deel van de openbare gezondheidszorg.

Deze verandering lijkt verband te houden met het ver­schijnen van vrouwen op het politieke toneel eerst zoals het geval was met de Sociaal-Democratische Vrouwen Propaganda Club als adressante aan de Gemeenteraad, vanaf 1919 als kiesgerechtigden en met de verkiezingswinst van de sociaal-democratische en vrijzinnig-democratische partijen.

Twee sociaal-democratische raadsleden, mevrouw Pothuis-Smit en mevrouw Tilanus, dienden opnieuw een voorstel tot verbetering en uitbreiding van de \"moederschapszorg\" in. Zij legden er de nadruk op dat het niet alleen om het belang van de zuige­ ling ging, maar dat ook het belang van de moeder moest tellen. Afgezien van dit nuanceverschil, kwam hun voorstel in grote lijnen overeen met het adres van 1911. Zij herhaalden dat zij de gemeen­ telijke zorg niet wilden beperken tot de armsten, maar wilden uitstrekken tot een zo groot mogelijk deel van de arbeidersklasse en de kleine midden­ stand. Dit punt, de mate van toegankelijkheid van een gemeentelijke zuigelingenzorg, was tot 1920 het belangrijkste principiële meningsverschil tus­ sen de sociaal-democratische vrouwen en Burgemees­ ter en Wethouders. In dat jaar besloot de Amster­ damse gemeenteraad tot instelling van éen gemeen­ telijke zuigelingenzorg, onder leiding van de Ge­ neeskundige Dienst en voor controle opengesteld voor alle gezonde zuigelingen \"die daaraan be­ hoefte hadden\".

Daarin zagen zij iets stuitends en immoreels: \"Het betrachten der moederplichten, uitingen van moederliefde, beloone men niet met geld\" (41). Een ander argument tegen \"zoogpremies\" was, dat de be­ dragen te klein waren om loonderving te compen­ seren, zodat moeders toch niet weerhouden zouden worden om buitenshuis te gaan werken (42). Aan moeders die door haar voedingstoestand de borst­ voeding niet of niet voldoende konden volhouden werd hulp gegeven, liefst in de vorm van verster­ kende middelen.

En al was \"het maatschappelijk kapitaal door het nog jeugdige kind vertegenwoor­digd betrekkelijk klein\", toch zouden \"het groot aantal der sterfgevallen en de jaarlijksche weder­keer ook aan deze kleine geldelijke verliezen een zeer groote maatschappelijke beteekenis\" geven (47).” (Daalen, 1981, p. 479)”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22478%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Daalen, 1981, p. 478</span>)</span> This argument of \"maatschappelijke verspilling\" is new to me and pretty cool.

Verwaarlo­ zing van kinderen was niet alleen een schadepost voor ons \"menschelijk gevoel\", maar ook voor de economische belangen van de maatschappij (48). Maatschappelijke schade was in politiek opzicht een betere rechtvaardiging van overheidsbemoeienis dan persoonlijk leed, maar lijkt zeker voor sommi­ gen, zoals de sociaal-democratische vrouwen niet meer geweest te zijn dan de \"koude berekening\", die zij als voorstanders van een statelijke zuige­ lingenzorg nodig hadden om hun positie te ver­ sterken.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22479%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Daalen, 1981, p. 479</span>)</span> This is also fascinating!

De stigmatisering die van een dergelijke werkwijze uitging, probeerden ze te ondervangen door uit­ breiding van de toegankelijkheid.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22485%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Daalen, 1981, p. 485</span>)</span></p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FBW6GYFFK%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%227RTDDU9A%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22485%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A24%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B46.3%2C262.526%2C348.301%2C270.936%5D%2C%5B46.1%2C251.726%2C353.645%2C260.136%5D%2C%5B46.8%2C240.926%2C367.502%2C249.336%5D%2C%5B46.5%2C230.126%2C355.001%2C238.536%5D%2C%5B47%2C219.326%2C367.754%2C227.736%5D%2C%5B46.8%2C208.526%2C340.947%2C216.936%5D%2C%5B45.8%2C197.726%2C354.805%2C206.136%5D%2C%5B46.6%2C187.126%2C360.403%2C195.536%5D%2C%5B46.3%2C176.326%2C346.495%2C184.736%5D%2C%5B47.1%2C165.526%2C368.001%2C173.936%5D%2C%5B46.3%2C154.726%2C341.098%2C163.136%5D%2C%5B46.6%2C143.926%2C354.45%2C152.336%5D%2C%5B45.8%2C133.126%2C353.702%2C141.536%5D%2C%5B46.3%2C122.526%2C353.604%2C130.936%5D%2C%5B46.1%2C111.726%2C361.247%2C120.136%5D%2C%5B46.6%2C100.926%2C360.55%2C109.336%5D%2C%5B46.3%2C90.426%2C347.251%2C98.836%5D%2C%5B46.3%2C79.626%2C134.5%2C88.036%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22485%22%7D%7D\">“Een andere reden om overheidsinstanties te ver­ kiezen boven liefdadigheidsinstellingen, was dat aan overheidsinstellingen gemakkelijker eisen kon­ den worden gesteld met betrekking tot de huisbe­ zoekers.

meeste ouders bezoeken regelmatig een consultatiebureau, zonder dat ze daartoe worden aangespoord. Dit gedrag is te be­ schouwen als een aanwijzing dat deskundige raad tegenwoordig vaker en meer vanzelfsprekend wordt ingewonnen dan aan het begin van deze eeuw. Een andere aanwijzing daarvoor is de toename van boe­ ken en tijdschriften op het gebied van de kinder­ verzorging. Ouders zijn bij het grootbrengen van kinderen afhankelijker geworden van professionele beroepskringen. Men kan daaruit afleiden, dat een van de doelstellingen van de vroege voorstanders van zuigelingenzorg bereikt is: het \"moderne\" op wetenschappelijke leest geschoeide \"moederen\" is bij de meeste ouders gebruikelijk geworden.”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22486%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Daalen, 1981, p. 486</span>)</span> This fits with the development that parents became more involved</p><p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FBW6GYFFK%22%2C%22annotationKey%22%3A%22NRGPQVEB%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22487%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A26%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B48.7%2C412.926%2C356.602%2C421.337%5D%2C%5B49.2%2C402.126%2C350.204%2C410.536%5D%2C%5B48.9%2C391.126%2C370.148%2C399.536%5D%2C%5B48.2%2C380.326%2C343.103%2C388.736%5D%2C%5B48.2%2C369.526%2C343.25%2C377.936%5D%2C%5B49.2%2C358.726%2C354.855%2C367.136%5D%2C%5B49.2%2C347.926%2C337.1%2C356.336%5D%2C%5B47.7%2C337.126%2C362.805%2C345.536%5D%2C%5B48.5%2C326.326%2C369.401%2C334.736%5D%2C%5B48.7%2C315.726%2C349.998%2C324.136%5D%2C%5B48.5%2C304.926%2C356.35%2C313.336%5D%2C%5B48.5%2C294.126%2C322.498%2C302.536%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FRHC6QVA3%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22487%22%7D%7D\">“De overheid heeft aan invloed verloren tegenover ouders en tegenover beroepsspecialisten.

      "abstractNote": "IN a paper on Auguste Forel and his campaign against alcoholism, read before the Society for the Study of Inebriety and Drug Addiction on July 12, Dr. J. D. Rolleston, after a short sketch of Forel's life, stated that though an active campaign against alcoholism had previously been carried out for many years in Great Britain and the United States, Forel was a pioneer in the scientific anti-alcoholic movement not only in Switzerland, his fatherland, but also on the continent of Europe. The lack of recognition of his work in Great Britain was attributed by Dr. Rolleston to two reasons. In the first place, Forel was strongly opposed to making the campaign against alcoholism inseparable from religion and Christianity in particular, as it is in this country and the United States. The second reason was the severe blow to Anglo-Saxon prudery and obscurantism caused by his classical work on the sexual question. On the other hand, the high appreciation of his work in foreign countries was shown by quotation of the opinions of eminent neurologists, psychiatrists and others in Germany, Hungary, Switzerland and the United States. Forel's contributions to the study of the alcohol problem were then considered under the headings of blastophthoria, alcoholism and the sexual question, exposure of popular errors concerning alcohol, such as the view that beer and wine do not cause alcoholism and the value of alcohol as a food, drug, and indispensable agent in sociability, alcohol and sport, and the treatment of alcoholism.",

      "abstractNote": "The so-called serials crisis has created a fiscal dilemma in libraries that cannot be addressed over the long term by simply increasing the serials budget. This situation has brought change to libraries and has challenged librarians to find new solutions to old problems. But there is little consensus as to what needs to be changed nor is there a broad-based method for assessing and analyzing t e conditions in order to reach agreement. The practice of entrepreneurship as espoused by Peter Drucker is examined for its application to the current crisis and as a methodology for change.",

      "abstractNote": "ABSTRACTFossils have been traded for centuries. Over the past two hundred years the market has developed into an organized enterprise, with fossils serving multiple functions as objects of scientific study, collectors' items, and investments. Finding fossils, digging them up or purchasing them, transporting, studying, and conserving them, and putting them on display was and still is expensive. Since the early nineteenth century, funding bodies, academic institutions and museums, philanthropists, dealers, collectors, amateurs, and professional paleontologists have constituted elaborate networks driven by collaboration, necessity, ambition, accolades, and capital to generate knowledge and produce geological artifacts, increasing our understanding of the natural world, advancing careers and institutions, and contributing to personal fortunes. The emergence of paleoanthropology as a scientific discipline around 1900 generated a scientific focus on the human story that was easy to sell. The scarcity of ancient human remains made it close to impossible for a commercial market to evolve, yet finding them required serious funding. Elaborate schemes for financing expeditions and excavations went hand in hand with individual aspirations, patronage, philanthropy, networks, and alliance building, as concession rights and access to sponsors were objects of regular political intrigues and often bitter disputes.",

      "abstractNote": "In recent years, the major science publishers have evolved away from publishing content providers to data analytics businesses. As platform companies, they generate high margins and use this capital to buy up alternative offers emerging from the science community and to expand into other business areas. The goal is to make themselves indispensable in all central processes of the research life cycle, so that we should see this as a vendor lock-in, just as it is known from the information sector. To this end, publishers have equipped their platforms with tools for comprehensive user tracking. At the same time, they are trying to bring access authentication under their control in order to ensure personalized access to each user. Some publishers or their parent corporations also intertwine with the security industry and (semi-)government actors in opaque data deals that also bring university networks into view. This essay attempts to analyze this development and outline the consequences. This text is a machine-based translation of the journal article »Das Lesen der Anderen« in order to provide easier access for non-German speaking interested parties, also the german language quotes were therefore transferred. Consider this version a »post-print derivative« and please refer to the original in case of references or citations: Siems, R. (2022).

      "abstractNote": "Parenting today is virtually synonymous with worry. We want to ensure that our children are healthy, that they get a good education, and that they grow up to be able to cope with the challenges of modern life. In our anxiety, we are keenly aware of our inability to know what is best for our children. When should we toilet train? What is the best way to encourage a fussy child to eat? How should we protect our children from disease and injury? Before the nineteenth century, maternal instinct—a mother’s “natural know-how”—was considered the only tool necessary for effective childrearing. Over the past two hundred years, however, science has entered the realm of motherhood in increasingly significant ways. In Perfect Motherhood, Rima D. Apple shows how the growing belief that mothers need to be savvy about the latest scientific directives has shifted the role of expert away from the mother and toward the professional establishment. Apple, however, argues that most women today are finding ways to negotiate among the abundance of scientific recommendations, their own knowledge, and the reality of their daily lives.",

      "abstractNote": "The aim of this article is to highlight the importance of the history of public health for public health research and practice itself. After summarily reviewing the current great vitality of the history of collective health oriented initiatives, we explain three particular features of the historical vantage point in public health, namely the importance of the context, the relevance of a diachronic attitude and the critical perspective. In order to illustrate those three topics, we bring up examples taken from three centuries of fight against malaria, the so called “re-emerging diseases” and the 1918 influenza epidemic. The historical approach enriches our critical perception of the social effects of initiatives undertaken in the name of public health, shows the shortcomings of public health interventions based on single factors and asks for a wider time scope in the assessment of current problems. The use of a historical perspective to examine the plurality of determinants in any particular health condition will help to solve the longlasting debate on the primacy of individual versus population factors, which has been particularly intense in recent times.",

Het doel daarvan was via zulke diensten de openbare preventieve zorg te stimuleren en te uniformeren, mede omdat in de ogen van de bewindsman de gezondheidscommissies slecht functioneerden. Aalberse wilde daarom een sluitend netwerk van districtdiensten om de gemeenten het rijksbeleid te laten uitvoeren. De behandeling van die wet werd echter een lijdensweg met uiteindelijk als resultaat dat het voorstel in 1933 werd ingetrokken. Kerkhoff geeft hiervoor enkele verklaringen.14 Ten eerste vonden veel kamerleden, zeker na het uitbreken van de economische crisis in 1929, de kosten veel te hoog, vooral voor het rijk. Het rijk zou namelijk voor de helft in de bekostiging bijdragen. Een tweede punt betrof de vraag of de diensten als een gedeconcentreerde rijksdienst moesten functioneren dan wel als gemeentelijke diensten. De meningen hierover bleven uiteen lopen, ook binnen de kring van de professionals. Het derde twistpunt betrof de relatie tussen overheid en particulier initiatief. In de beginfase van het behandelingsproces speelde dat punt nog niet zo, maar gedurende de jaren twintig was het particulier initiatief groot geworden: tal van particuliere instellingen, overigens met behulp van subsidies van rijk, provincies en gemeenten, hadden, geordend binnen de diverse ‘zuilen’, activiteiten op het gebied van de openbare gezondheidszorg op zich genomen en wel op regionale”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FTJM79VL4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Van den Ouweland, 2005, p. 20</span>)</span> Kerkhoff 1994, p. 39-43</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FEL9ZTRUD%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A21%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B84.921%2C629.453%2C425.194%2C639.086%5D%2C%5B84.921%2C617.452%2C425.116%2C627.085%5D%2C%5B84.921%2C605.452%2C425.075%2C615.085%5D%2C%5B84.921%2C593.451%2C425.139%2C603.084%5D%2C%5B84.921%2C581.451%2C425.088%2C591.084%5D%2C%5B84.921%2C569.451%2C425.113%2C579.084%5D%2C%5B84.921%2C557.45%2C425.156%2C567.083%5D%2C%5B84.921%2C545.45%2C425.187%2C555.083%5D%2C%5B84.921%2C533.449%2C425.138%2C543.082%5D%2C%5B84.921%2C521.449%2C123.016%2C531.082%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FTJM79VL4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2221%22%7D%7D\">“schaal. En zij lieten van zich horen. De meeste kamerleden voelden er dan ook per slot van rekening niet voor om dat particulier initiatief tegen zich in het harnas te jagen. Bovendien speelden de grondbeginselen van de confessionele zuilen een belangrijke rol: de soevereiniteit in eigen kring van de protestanten en het subsidiariteitsbeginsel van de katholieken. Tegen aantasting van zuilenorganisaties was men derhalve ook om principiële redenen.

Hierbij dachten zij aan de activiteiten van de kruisverenigingen, vooral vanwege hun omvangrijke zuigelingenen kleuterzorg, activiteiten die in de Structuurnota overigens al niet genoemd waren als mogelijke nieuwe taken voor de gezondheidsdiensten. Aan de activiteiten van de kruisverenigingen, zo stond in een in 1975 aangenomen motie VederSmit, moest een ruime en adequate plaats worden gegeven.21”</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FTJM79VL4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Van den Ouweland, 2005, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FEL9ZTRUD%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23ffd400%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2223%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A23%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B84.921%2C269.453%2C425.076%2C279.086%5D%2C%5B84.921%2C257.452%2C425.181%2C267.086%5D%2C%5B84.922%2C245.452%2C425.2%2C255.085%5D%2C%5B84.922%2C233.452%2C425.188%2C243.085%5D%2C%5B84.922%2C221.451%2C425.171%2C231.084%5D%2C%5B84.922%2C209.451%2C425.158%2C219.084%5D%2C%5B84.922%2C197.451%2C425.111%2C207.084%5D%2C%5B84.922%2C185.45%2C425.121%2C195.083%5D%2C%5B84.922%2C173.45%2C425.099%2C183.083%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F3736728%2Fitems%2FTJM79VL4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%7D\">“Kerkhoff geeft drie verklaringen voor het feit dat dit keer het idee van een landelijk dekkend netwerk het op zichzelf wel haalde in het parlement.22 Ten eerste ondervond het politiek en maatschappelijk weinig weerstand dat de overheid zich steeds meer taken aanmat op het terrein van de volksgezondheid.

      "abstractNote": "Comparative historical research on the the intensity, diversity and fluidity of public discourses has been severely hampered by the extraordinary task of manually gathering and processing large sets of opinionated data in news media in different countries. At most 50,000 documents have been systematically studied in a single comparative historical project in the subject area of heredity and eugenics. Digital techniques, like the text mining tools WAHSP and BILAND we have developed in two successive demonstrator projects, are able to perform advanced forms of multi-lingual text-mining in much larger data sets of newspapers. We describe the development and use of WAHSP and BILAND to support historical discourse analysis in large digitized news media corpora. Furthermore, we argue how text mining techniques overcome the problem of traditional historical research that only documents explicitly referring to eugenics issues and debates can be incorporated. Our tools are able to provide information on ideas and notions about heredity, genetics and eugenics that circulate in discourses that are not directly related to eugenics (e.g., sport, education and economics).",

      "abstractNote": "In sociology, a boundary object is information, such as specimens, field notes, and maps, used in different ways by different communities. Boundary objects are plastic, interpreted differently across communities but with enough immutable content to maintain integrity. The concept was introduced by Susan Leigh Star and James R. Griesemer in a 1989 publication (p. 393):\nIn their article, Star and Griesemer describe the importance of boundary objects and methods standardization in the development of the Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. Some of the boundary objects that they list include specimens, field notes, and maps of particular territories. These objects interact with members of various social groups (including amateur collectors and museum professionals) but are used to very different ends by each (p. 408).This paper has since been widely cited and the concept of a boundary object has been adopted in computer science (particularly computer supported cooperative work), information science, and management, particularly when considering cross-disciplinary work and collaboration, either within one organization or with the boundary object helping to focus the efforts of multiple organizations.  Geoffrey Bowker and Star developed the concept further in the book Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences.",

      "abstractNote": "The late 1960s witnessed a key conjunction between political activism and the history of science. Science, whether seen as a touchstone of rationality or of oppression, was fundamental to all sides in the era of the Vietnam War. This essay examines the historian Robert Maxwell Young's turn to Marxism and radical politics during this period, especially his widely cited account of the ‘common context’ of nineteenth-century biological and social theorizing, which demonstrated the centrality of Thomas Robert Malthus's writings on population for Charles Darwin's formulation of the theory of evolution by natural selection. From Young's perspective, this history was bound up with pressing contemporary issues: ideologies of class and race in neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory, the revival of Malthusian population control, and the role of science in military conflict. The aim was to provide a basis for political action – the ‘head revolution’ that would accompany radical social change. The radical force of Young's argument was blunted in subsequent decades by disciplinary developments within history of science, including the emergence of specialist Darwin studies, a focus on practice and the changing political associations of the history of ideas. Young's engaged standpoint, however, has remained influential even as historians moved from understanding science as ideology to science as work.",

/>Publishing Services Terms<br /><br />Scope and Commercial Terms<br /><br />I.<br /><br />Corresponding authors of the Institutions shall be referred to as “Corresponding Author(s)” and<br />shall have the right, during the term of the Agreement, to publish an unlimited number of journal<br />articles per year in Elsevier Gold Open Access and Hybrid Journals, if accepted for publication,<br />and subject to the terms of this Schedule 4 Publishing Services Terms.<br /><br />Both parties are committed to reach 100% Open Access during the term of this Agreement. In<br />line with this joint ambition, Elsevier offers Corresponding Authors the possibility to publish<br />Gold Open Access in the widest possible range of Elsevier journals under the Terms of this<br />Schedule 4, As per the effective date of this Agreement 95% of the journal articles by the<br />Corresponding Authors are eligible to be published Open Access. For the remainder of the<br />journal articles, Elsevier will continue to strive for sustainable immediate open access options<br />across its journal portfolio to support the 100% Open Access goal. Notwithstanding that the Cell<br />Press and the Lancet full gold Open Access journals and the hybrid journal titles Trends in<br />Biotechnology and Trends in Cancer are included in the Publishing Services, the remaining Cell<br />Press and the Lancet non-full Open Access journals are excluded from immediate open access<br />options in the Agreement however both parties will work diligently together during the term of<br />this Agreement to include such journals in order to support the 100% Open Access goal. A title<br />list with all journal titles that are covered under the Terms of this Schedule 4 Publishing Services<br />can be found in Annex A to Schedule 4 hereto. The list of journal titles covered under the Reading<br />Services can be found at Schedule 1.1 and the respective Annexes A/B/C/D to Schedule 1.1.<br /><br />If Elsevier launches a new Gold Open Access journal or acquires a Gold Open Access journal<br />that follows the same publishing services as described in this Schedule 4 such journal will be<br />added to the Publishing Services as soon as possible but in any event not later than at the end of<br />every quarter. Except for the Cell Press and the Lancet non-full Open Access journals, if Elsevier<br />launches a new Hybrid journal or converts a subscription journal to Hybrid or Gold OA during<br />the term of this Agreement, such journals will be added to the Publishing Services unless Elsevier<br />has a reasonable objection,<br /><br />Workflow<br /><br />4.<br /><br />In Elsevier’s journal workflow, Corresponding Authors will specify their affiliation and the<br />research funding. Based on this data, Elsevier will provide the Corresponding Authors with the<br />relevant publishing options on the Elsevier Open Access platform (the “EOA Platform”).<br /><br />In Elsevier’s journal workflow, Gold Open Access will be the preselected choice. In the event a<br />Corresponding Author has chosen Gold Open Access, the journal article, if accepted for<br />publication, shall be published under a CC-BY (Elsevier will indicate the Customer’s preferred<br />license choice), or CC-BY-NC-ND license as determined by the submitting Corresponding<br />Author, subject to the conditions and process set forth herein. If the Corresponding Author<br />chooses a license other than CC-BY, Elsevier will facilitate upon request of the Corresponding<br />Author the possibility to change the license to CC-BY.<br /><br />Customer will have access to the EOA Platform to validate the eligibility of the Corresponding<br />Author. The EOA Platform will present the Customer with all information needed to validate,<br />on behalf of the SURFmarket and its Institutions, validate the eligibility of the Corresponding<br />Author, such as the details of the Corresponding Author, DOI, article title, article type, journal<br /><br />1),<br /><br />12.<br /><br />title, research funding, to the extent that the Corresponding Author has provided such<br />information.<br /><br />Customer is responsible for informing Corresponding Authors who wish to submit journal article<br />manuscripts that they are required to identify themselves as a Corresponding Author in the course<br />of Elsevier’s publishing workflow.<br /><br />The EOA Platform requires Customer to validate that the relevant Corresponding Author is<br />affiliated with the relevant Institution.<br /><br />Elsevier shall on a monthly basis, provide SURFmarket and each Institution with a report of the<br />journal articles that are accepted in Open Access under this Agreement, including the<br />Corresponding Author’s institutional affiliation per Institution. The report shall include the<br />following information: Corresponding Author Full Name, Corresponding Author E-Mail,<br />Corresponding Author Institution Name, Journal Title, ISSN, Journal Publishing Category,<br />Article Type, Article PIT, Article DOI, Article Full Name, CC License, Article Access Type,<br />Author Journey, Completion Links, Article Submission Date, Article Acceptance Date, Author<br />Journey Completion Date. Elsevier will provide this report in July of each year for the period<br />‘January — June’ and before January 15th for the period ‘January — December’ of the previous<br />year. Elsevier agrees to provide additional reporting to the Customer regarding the<br />Corresponding Author journal articles published in Elsevier journals, as discussed from time to<br />time between Elsevier and the Customer.<br /><br />. Due to the experimental nature of certain aspects of the Publishing Services as described in this<br /><br />Schedule 4, Elsevier and Customer agree to collaborate to determine potential enhancements to<br />the workflow described herein.<br /><br />Elsevier will clearly indicate the availability of the Publishing Services as described in this<br />Agreement to Corresponding Authors within the publication process. Elsevier will inform the<br />Corresponding Authors that they do not need to pay article publishing charges for the publication<br />of Open Access articles in journals that are part of the Publishing Services.<br /><br />If, despite the correct information provided by the Corresponding Author to Elsevier during the<br />publication process, Elsevier fails to identify the author as Corresponding Author and then<br />publishes the journal article under a subscription model, Elsevier shall be responsible to convert<br />the journal article within 30 days so that it is published pursuant to the chosen Open Access<br />license. If this occurs more than ten times per month (for the avoidance of doubt each time with<br />respect to different error types), Elsevier and Customer shall discuss the current workflow and<br />agree upon measures to improve the workflow process.<br /><br />. Upon publication of a journal article, Elsevier will register the metadata on CrossRef, including,<br /><br />but not limited to: (1) the journal article’s digital object identifier (DOI), (2) the funding<br />metadata, including funder name and grant number, in the metadata in Funder Registry (on<br />CrossRef), (3) bibliographic citations and (4) the Open Access license type.<br /><br />. Elsevier will report annually how many Elsevier’s journals converted during the year from/to a<br /><br />subscription model to/from an Open Access model, including hybrid model,<br /><br />. If a journal becomes no longer eligible to Open Access publication under these terms but still<br /><br />remains published or controlled by Elsevier and/or any of its affiliates, Customer will get<br />continuous access to this journal during the rest of the term.<br /><br />All journals in Schedule 4 are eligible to open access publication under these OA Terms.<br /><br />Annex A to Schedule 4<br /><br />Titles list for the a Services<br /><br />0940-9602 Annals of Anatomy Hybrid<br />0001-4575 Accident Analysis and Prevention Hybrid<br />0306-4603 Addictive Behaviors Hybrid<br />0099-1333 The Journal of Academic Librarianship Hybrid<br />1061-9518 Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation Hybrid<br />0748-5751 Journal of Accounting Education Hybrid<br />1467-0895 International Journal of Accounting Information Systems Hybrid<br />2666-7991 Applied Corpus Linguistics Hybrid<br />0065-1281 Acta Histochemica Hybrid<br />1146-609X Acta Oecologica Hybrid<br />0001-6918 Acta Psychologica Hybrid<br />0001-706X Acta Tropica Hybrid<br />1887-8369 Revista Internacional de Acupuntura Hybrid<br />1875-2136 Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases Hybrid<br />2214-8604 Additive Manufacturing Hybrid<br />0965-9978 Advances in Engineering Software Hybrid<br />1570-8705 Ad Hoc Networks Hybrid<br />0882-6110 Advances in Accounting Hybrid<br />Archives des Maladies Professionnelles et de<br />1775-8785 l'Environnement Hybrid<br />0169-409X Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews Hybrid<br />1474-0346 Advanced Engineering Informatics Hybrid<br />0309-1708 Advances in Water Resources Hybrid<br />1875-9637 Aeolian Research Hybrid<br />1047-2797 Annals of Epidemiology Hybrid<br />1464-343X Journal of African Earth Sciences Hybrid<br />1270-9638 Aerospace Science and Technology Hybrid<br />AEUE - International Journal of Electronics and<br />1434-8411 Communications Hybrid<br />Annales francaises d’ oto-rhino-laryngologie et de<br />1879-7261 pathologie cervico-faciale Hybrid<br />0167-8809 Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment Hybrid<br />0167-4943 Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics Hybrid<br />0890-4065 Journal of Aging Studies Hybrid<br />0168-1923 Agricultural and Forest Meteorology Hybrid<br />0308-521X Agricultural Systems Hybrid<br />0378-3774 Agricultural Water Management Hybrid<br />2212-9588 Advances in Integrative Medicine Hybrid<br />0197-4556 The Arts in Psychotherapy Hybrid<br />0002-9149 The American Journal of Cardiology Hybrid<br /><br />0002-9343 The American Journal of Medicine Hybrid<br />2589-9333 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM Hybrid<br />0002-9394 American Journal! of Ophthalmology Hybrid<br />1876-2018 Asian Journal of Psychiatry Hybrid<br />0002-9610 The American Journal of Surgery Hybrid<br />0741-8329 Alcohol Hybrid<br />1040-2608 Advances in Life Course Research Hybrid<br />2211-9264 Algal Research Hybrid<br />2213-6657 Analytic Methods in Accident Research Hybrid<br />0096-3003 Applied Mathematics and Computation Hybrid<br />Archives des Maladies du Coeur et des Vaisseaux —<br />1261-694xX Pratique Hybrid<br />0893-9659 Applied Mathematics Letters Hybrid<br />1061-3315 Atlas of the Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North A Hybrid<br />2213-3054 Anthropocene Hybrid<br />0003-4266 Annales d'Endocrinologie Hybrid<br />0306-4549 Annals of Nuclear Energy Hybrid<br />2352-4065 Animal Gene Hybrid<br />0377-8401 Animal Feed Science and Technology Hybrid<br />0378-4320 Animal Reproduction Science Hybrid<br />0151-9638 Annales de Dermatologie et de Vénéréologie Hybrid<br />0242-6498 Annales de Pathologie Hybrid<br />0294-1260 Annales de chirurgie plastique esthétique Hybrid<br />European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck<br />1879-7296 diseases Hybrid<br />0887-6185 Journal of Anxiety Disorders Hybrid<br />0003-9969 Archives of Oral Biology Hybrid<br />0361-3682 Accounting, Organizations and Society Hybrid<br />0003-682X Applied Acoustics Hybrid<br />0168-0072 Annals of Pure and Applied Logic Hybrid<br />0926-860X Applied Catalysis A, General Hybrid<br />0926-3373 Applied Catalysis B: Environmental Hybrid<br />0306-2619 Applied Energy Hybrid<br />0307-904X Applied Mathematical Modelling Hybrid<br />2352-9407 Applied Materials Today Hybrid<br />0141-1187 Applied Ocean Research Hybrid<br />0193-3973 Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology Hybrid<br />0195-6663 Appetite Hybrid<br />0926-9851 Journal of Applied Geophysics Hybrid<br />0168-1591 Applied Animal Behaviour Science Hybrid<br />0929-1393 Applied Soil Ecology Hybrid<br />0169-4332 Applied Surface Science Hybrid<br />0304-3770 Aquatic Botany Hybrid<br /><br />0166-445xX Aquatic Toxicology Hybrid<br />0044-8486 Aquaculture Hybrid<br />0144-8609 Aquacultural Engineering Hybrid<br />2352-2267 Archaeologica!

PLATFORM PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AGREEMENT<br />Schedule 5<br /><br />PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TERMS<br /><br />SECTION 1. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.<br /><br />1.1 Services.<br /><br />Elsevier agrees to make available to Institutions certain non-exclusive services on a pilot basis laid down<br />in a mutually executed Statement of Work (as defined herein) (“Services”) and certain deliverables, if<br />any deliverables are to be provided through such Services, (each a “Deliverable”), subject to these<br />professional services terms and conditions (“Terms”). The Services and the Deliverables, if any, on a<br />pilot basis will be hereinafter referred to collectively as “Professional Services”. The Collaboration<br />Principles, as defined below, shall form an integral part of the Terms in respect of each individual pilot<br />and shall as such be further detailed and operationalised in each Statement of Work (hereinafter: a<br />“Statement of Work” or “SOW”). The Services shall be monitored as part of the Governance structure as<br />set forth in Schedule 5.1 of this Agreement.<br /><br />1.2... Collaboration Principles.<br />The Institutions and Elsevier agree that the Services shall comply with the following general<br />collaboration principles (the \"Collaboration Principles\"):<br /><br />Interoperability and vendor neutrality: Authorized Users and Institutions are allowed to use their own or<br />third party products and services as part of the Services. Elsevier shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure<br />that the Professional Services are interoperable, both on the input (uploaded) and output side (created),<br />the parties may further detail the requirements for such interoperability in the relevant SOW. Participation<br />in the Professional Services is at each Institution’s sole discretion and a pilot shall only commence if<br />there is a minimum participation by at least three Institutions. Elsevier acknowledges Customer’s<br />preference that for the same Services multiple commercial third parties may be separately engaged in<br />different pilots. Institution shall not, pursuant to the Agreement, be required to enter into any SOW with<br />Elsevier or exclusively purchase any part of the Professional Services from Elsevier (including, without<br />limitation, the examples of pilots set forth hereinafter) under any SOW, and shall at all times be free to<br />collaborate with third parties in the development or provision of services and deliverables which are the<br />same or materially similar to any Services or Deliverables. Elsevier wil] at the Institution’s request,<br />provide all reasonable cooperation to make available data input, uploaded or created by Institution or on<br />behalf of the Institution or its Authorised User in the context of the Services to other vendors or<br />publishers.<br /><br />Transparency, inclusion and collaboration: The Services and resulting Deliverables are aimed to make<br />science and research more transparent, efficient, inclusive, openly and freely accessible, and<br />collaborative, allowing for the broadest possible audiences to have the opportunity to participate, to make<br />use of and to contribute to the scientific process based on the ambitions to ensure that a level playing<br />field will be created to ensure such Professional Services are open and transparent using common<br />standards for data exchange enabling a third party vendor or publisher to participate and contribute to the<br />research data uploaded or created by or on behalf of the Institution or its Authorised User along with or<br />instead of Elsevier. Insights derived, output created and lessons learned from the Professional Services<br />will be freely usable by the Institutions be, to a reasonable extent, made available to third parties.<br /><br />Access to research data and metadata: Elsevier will give enduring access during the Term to all research<br />data, including metadata, analytics and information, which has been input, uploaded or created by or on<br />behalf of the Institution or its Authorised User or enriched by the Institution or on behalf of the Institution<br />or Elsevier using the Professional Services to the Institution or to third parties that are acting on behalf<br />of the Institution unless the Institution has explicitly stated that (parts of) data should remain confidential.<br /><br />Data portability: \\nstitution shall be entitled to transfer the data provided, uploaded or created by or on<br />behalf of the Institution or its Authorized Users as part of the Professional Services to its own or to a<br />third party host environment, and Elsevier shall provide all reasonable cooperation to enable such transfer<br />at Institution's first request. Upon termination or expiration of the relevant SOW the data uploaded or<br />created and hosted by Elsevier as part of the Professional Services will remain accessible to the<br />Institutions and to the Authorized Users for a period of six (6) months from the date of termination or<br />expiration. During the aforementioned period, the Institutions may request in writing an onsite delivery<br />of any data owned by the Institutions in a mutually agreed upon format (and in any event in such standard<br />format as is common in the industry and/or indicated by the Professional Services concerned), and<br />Elsevier shall then provide such data to the relevant Institution in such format at no additional cost and<br />without undue delay.<br /><br />Examples of the Professional Services could be:<br /><br />USE CASE DESCRIPTION<br /><br />|. Aggregation and deduplication Improve findability and visibility of NL research outputs by<br />service to based upon CRIS aggregating and deduplicating separate CRIS systems into a<br />systems Pure Community module available to all institutions which can<br />serve as a building block to a NL open knowledge base.<br /><br />2.

      "abstractNote": "ABSTRACTThis essay argues that taking the economy seriously in histories of science could not only extend the range of activities studied but also change—often quite radically—our understanding of well-known cases and instances in twentieth-century science. It shows how scientific intellectuals and historians of science have followed the money as a means of critique of particular forms of science and of particular conceptions of science. It suggests the need to go further, to a much broader implicit definition of what constitutes science—one that implies a criticism of much history of twentieth-century science for defining it implicitly and inappropriately in very restrictive ways.",

      "abstractNote": "Scholars studying the history of heredity suggest that during the 19th-century biologists and anthropologists viewed characteristics as a collection of blended qualities passed on from the parents. Many argued that those characteristics could be very much affected by environmental circumstances, which scholars call the inheritance of acquired characteristics or “soft” heredity. According to these accounts, Gregor Mendel reconceived heredity – seeing distinct hereditary units that remain unchanged by the environment. This resulted in particular traits that breed true in succeeding generations, or “hard” heredity. The author argues that polygenist anthropology (an argument that humanity consisted of many species) and anthropometry in general should be seen as a hardening of heredity. Using a debate between Philadelphia anthropologist and physician, Samuel G. Morton, and Charleston naturalist and reverend, John Bachman, as a springboard, the author contends that polygenist anthropologists hardened heredity by conceiving of durable traits that might reappear even after a race has been eliminated. Polygenists saw anthropometry (the measurement of humans) as one method of quantifying hereditary qualities. These statistical ranges were ostensibly characteristics that bred true and that defined racial groups. Further, Morton’s interest in hybridity and racial mixing demonstrates that the polygenists focused as much on the transmission and recognition of “amalgamations” of characters as they did on racial categories themselves. The author suggests that seeing race science as the study of heritable, statistical characteristics rather than broad categories helps explain why “race” is such a persistent cultural phenomenon.",

      "abstractNote": "The design of models that govern diseases in population is commonly built on information and data gathered from past outbreaks. However, epidemic outbreaks are never captured in statistical data alone but are communicated by narratives, supported by empirical observations. Outbreak reports discuss correlations between populations, locations and the disease to infer insights into causes, vectors and potential interventions. The problem with these narratives is usually the lack of consistent structure or strong conventions, which prohibit their formal analysis in larger corpora. Our interdisciplinary research investigates more than 100 reports from the third plague pandemic (1894-1952) evaluating ways of building a corpus to extract and structure this narrative information through text mining and manual annotation. In this paper we discuss the progress of our ongoing exploratory project, how we enhance optical character recognition (OCR) methods to improve text capture, our approach to structure the narratives and identify relevant entities in the reports. The structured corpus is made available via Solr enabling search and analysis across the whole collection for future research dedicated, for example, to the identification of concepts. We show preliminary visualisations of the characteristics of causation and differences with respect to gender as a result of syntactic-category-dependent corpus statistics. Our goal is to develop structured accounts of some of the most significant concepts that were used to understand the epidemiology of the third plague pandemic around the globe. The corpus enables researchers to analyse the reports collectively allowing for deep insights into the global epidemiological consideration of plague in the early twentieth century.",

      "abstractNote": "This article documents how biomedical researchers in the United Kingdom understand and enact the idea of “openness.” This is of particular interest to researchers and science policy worldwide in view of the recent adoption of pioneering policies on Open Science and Open Access by the U.K. government—policies whose impact on and implications for research practice are in need of urgent evaluation, so as to decide on their eventual implementation elsewhere. This study is based on 22 in-depth interviews with U.K. researchers in systems biology, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics, which were conducted between September 2013 and February 2014. Through an analysis of the interview transcripts, we identify seven core themes that characterize researchers’ understanding of openness in science and nine factors that shape the practice of openness in research. Our findings highlight the implications that Open Science policies can have for research processes and outcomes and provide recommendations for enhancing their content, effectiveness, and implementation.",

I characterize the distinctive kinds of expertise about science that such philanthropy presumed and cultivated based on analyses of, first, documents connected to interventions in European and South American mathematics and, second, a 1946 handbook prepared by Warren Weaver to guide new programme officers. Rockefeller officers developed elaborate infrastructures for understanding and intervening in the personal and institutional conditions of scientific investigation, while deliberately diverting attention away from the particulars of the science they supported. Their approach, indicative of operating strategies and assumptions for scientific funding bodies in this period, shaped access and authority across the major enterprises of late modern science, defining both what science and which scientists could benefit from new resources and opportunities.</p></section>",

      "abstractNote": "This paper attempts to illustrate the implications of a simultaneous redirection of the big publishers’ business strategy towards open access business models and the acquisition of scholarly infrastructure utilizing the conceptual framework of rent-seeking theory. To document such a transformation, we utilized financial databases to analyze the mergers and acquisitions of the top publicly traded academic publishers. We then performed a service analysis to situate the acquisitions of publishers within the knowledge and education life-cycles, illustrating what we term to be their vertical integration within their respective expansion target life-cycles. Implications of higher education institutions’ increased dependency towards the companies and increased influence by the companies on the institution and individual researcher were noted from the vertical integration of products. Said vertical integration is analyzed via a rent theory framework and described to be a form of rent-seeking complementary to the redirection of business strategies to open access. Finally, the vertical integration is noted to generate exclusionary effects upon researchers/institutions in the global south.",

Its reputation as humdrum and rule-bound is not necessarily undeserved, yet it makes possible a variety of activities on a scale that would otherwise be out of reach. Here we survey and ponder some of its diverse forms as they have adapted to diverse aims and circumstances evolved over several centuries.\n\n \n\nThis afterword is part of a special issue entitled “Histories of Bureaucratic Knowledge,” edited by Sebastian Felten and Christine von Oertzen.",

      "abstractNote": "This essay outlines the various analytical frameworks related to the history of race science that contribute to a “Latin” intellectual culture and tradition. In addition to defining Latinity as applied to the history of science, this article examines the troubled relationship between Latin American history and histories of science characterized as global. Similarly, it explores intellectual linkages across the Global South regarding racial mixture and the legacy of colonialism. It concludes by considering how a Latin perspective can illuminate the continued hegemony of ideas and scientific practices originating in North America and northern Europe.",

      "abstractNote": "Investigations of how the understanding of heredity developed in scientific, medical, agro-industrial, and political contexts of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.This book examines the wide range of scientific and social arenas in which the concept of inheritance gained relevance in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although genetics emerged as a scientific discipline during this period, the idea of inheritance also played a role in a variety of medical, agricultural, industrial, and political contexts. The book, which follows an earlier collection, Heredity Produced (covering the period 1500 to 1870), addresses heredity in national debates over identity, kinship, and reproduction; biopolitical conceptions of heredity, degeneration, and gender; agro-industrial contexts for newly emerging genetic rationality; heredity and medical research; and the genealogical constructs and experimental systems of genetics that turned heredity into a representable and manipulable object. Taken together, the essays in Heredity Explored show that a history of heredity includes much more than the history of genetics, and that knowledge of heredity was always more than the knowledge formulated as Mendelism. It was the broader public discourse of heredity in all its contexts that made modern genetics possible.ContributorsCaroline Arni, Christophe Bonneuil, Christina Brandt, Luis Campos, Jean-Paul Gaudillière, Bernd Gausemeier, Jean Gayon, Veronika Lipphardt, Ilana Löwy, J.

ITT. 31. 3608 Zaterdag 4 Augustus 1934<br /><br />: ARTS EN SAMENLEVING.<br /><br />| BESPREKINGEN.<br /><br />De besmettelijke ziekten in het jaar 1932. — Het Meinummer<br />| van de Verslagen en Mededeelingen betreffende de Volksgezondhetd<br />| : (1934, No. 5) brengt het door dr. EYKEL onderteekende verslag<br />| omtrent ,,het toezicht op de handhaving van de wettelijke bepalin-<br />gen betreffende besmettelijke ziekten, enz.’’ over het jaar 1932.<br />Dit betreft dus het laatste jaar van dr. TERBURGH’s werkzaamheid,<br />tevens is het het laatste verslag betrekking hebbend op het tijdperk,<br />toen twee hoofdinspecteurs het geneeskundige toezicht deelden. -<br />Het afscheid van dr. TERBURGH herdacht ik reeds bij de samen-<br />vatting van het laatste door hem onderteekende verslag over 193I 1).<br /><br />1932 had een bij uitstek laag sterftecijfer; het bedroeg voor de<br />eerste maal minder dan 9 per L000 inwoners (8.99) 2).<br /><br />Ziekten van groep A werden er in het verslagjaar niet aangege-<br /><br />ven. Omtrent de ziekten van groep B vindt men, als gewoonlik,<br />| vele bijzonderheden en vergelijkingen met vroegere jaren.<br />De aangifte van febris typhoidea, 490 gevallen met 60  stert-<br />gevallen, maakt weinig verschil met die voor 1931 (460 en 53); de<br />typheuse vorm van paratyphus B staat met 189 (5 sterfgevallen)<br />geboekt. Het standpunt van dr. TERBURGH, dat de gastro-enteriti-<br />sche vorm van paratyphus B niet zou vallen onder het Koninklijke<br />Besluit van 1 October 1929, wordt terecht verlaten: 69 ziekte-<br />gevallen met niet minder dan 10 sterfgevallen toonen trouwens<br />voldoende aan, dat het den hoofdinspecteur niet onverschillig mag<br />zijn van het voorkomen en de verspreiding van deze infectie door<br />verplichte aangifte nauwkeurig op de hoogte te blijven.<br /><br />Van dysenteria bacillaris vermeldt het verslag 753 gevallen (22<br />sterfgevallen); van febris undulans 21 (0), van roodvonk 9788 (61),<br />van diphtherie 3353 (273), van meningitis cerebrospinalts epidemica<br />164 (72), van poliomyelitis anterior acuta 242 (26), van encephalitrs<br />lethargica 60 (36). ,<br /><br />Geen van deze cijfers is verontrustend hoog, zooals uit onder-<br />staand tabelletje moge blijken.<br /><br />-Roodvonk | Diphtherie | Meningitis Poliomyelitis | Encephal. leth.<br />ziekte-| sterf- |ziekte-| sterf- jziekte- sterf- |ziekte- sterf- | ziekte- | sterf- ~<br />gev. | gev. | gev. | gev. | gev. | gev. | gev. | gev. | sev. gev.<br />1932....| 9788} 61 | 5353 | 273 | 164 72 | 242 26 80 36<br />I93I....| 8229 55 | 5693 3Iz | 178 TOL | 136 17 68 52<br />1930....| 13183} 84 | 7450 | 439 | 140 85 | 590 | 54 89 35<br />1929....| 15888} 128 | 4888 317 | 152 80 | 507 59 85 39<br />1928....| 15335} 156 | 4417 299 | TI9 68 75 18 67 46<br />1927....| 14938} 122 | 3620 250 | 108 46 50 I4 IOL 64.<br />1926....| 14659) 114 | 3629 | 205 93 55 49 16 85 59<br />1925....| 11619} TI5 4714 257 | 115 67 | ~ 32 9 Ii7 59<br />1924....| 6635 54 | 4451 237 | 106 56 | 38 19 80 53<br /><br />1) Dit Tijdschvift, 1932, Il, bladzijde 5604.<br />2) In 1933: 8.8.<br /><br />NT vG 78. Ill. 3h 3600, Zaterdag 4 Augustus 1034<br /><br />De sterfte aan mazelen en kinkhoest was in het verslagjaar even-<br />eens gunstig. .<br /><br />Een teleurstellende ervaring had men in het jaar 1932 met de zekie<br />van WEIL. Tegenover 26 en 30 gevallen in de voorafgaande jaren ston-<br />den in het verslagjaar 207 ziektegevallen met 16 sterfgevallen. Hoe-<br />veel gevallen er niet herkend zijn — vele gevallen verloopen zonder<br />icterus-— is niet te schatten.

Er werd behandeld met<br /><br />T.A.U. (toxine-antitoxine Utrecht), met anatoxine (volgens RAMON ><br /><br />met formaline ongiftig gemaakt diphtherietoxine), met Diro<br />(T.A.U. + toxine van den roodvonkstreptococcus) en Anaro<br />(anatoxine + roodvonktoxine). De ervaringen van dr. DOYER in<br />Noord Holland in 38 gemeenten (276.792 inwoners) hebben betrek-<br />king op 92000 kinderen, van welke er ruim 20000 allen driemaal<br />met Diro of Anaro zijn geimmuniseerd. Door roodvonk werden<br /><br />1) De verslaggever geeft de voorkeur aan de diagnose: ,,prikkeling van het<br />centrale zenuwstelsel”’, een verzachtende term, die mij in een ambtelijk verslag<br />haast onnoodig voorzichtig voorkomt. Ref.<br /><br />N. T.v.G. 78. TIL. 31. 2610 Zaterdag 4 Augustus 1934<br /><br />aangetast 31 volledig geénten en 308 niet-geénten. De morbiditeit<br /><br />der 72000 niet geénte kinderen was dus driemaal zoo hoog als die .<br /><br />der 20.000 geénten. Jammer dat het, buiten het gebied van enkele<br />goed. toegeruste gemeentelijke gezondheidsdiensten, bij zulke be-<br />perkte proefnemingen moet blijven. De vraag mag daarom worden<br />gesteld, of vaccinatie tegen pokken, immunisatie tegen diphtherie<br />en roodvonk, wellicht gerekend kunnen worden tot de taak der<br />talrijke plaatselijke vereenigingen, werkzaam ten behoeve van de<br />hygiéne van het kind. ;<br /><br />Vaccinatie en immunisatie zijn immers handelingen van genees-<br />kundige voorzorg; zij kunnen — afgezien van wettelijkken dwang —<br />slechts worden gepropageerd door plaatselijke instellingen, die op<br /><br />de verschillende gebieden der praeventieve geneeskunde werkzaam,<br /><br />in nauwe aanraking met de beVolking zijn.<br /><br />Ons staatstoezicht op de Volksgezondheid heeft deze aanraking<br />niet; het kan leiding en steun geven, doch de propaganda binnen<br />kleine groepen, de uitvoering der entingen van de individuen, moet<br />het aan anderen overlaten.<br /><br />Mogen de ,,Kruis’’vereenigingen en de zoo juist gereorganiseerde<br />Nederlandsche Bond tot Bescherming van zuigelingen en kleuters en<br />ter bevordering van praenatale zorg dit vraagstuk eens onder de oogen<br />willen zien. J. J. VAN LOGHEM.<br /><br />BERICHTEN EN MEDEDEELINGEN.<br /><br />DOOFHEID DOOR INFLUENZA. —— Fritz Herper, van de Clarke School<br />for the Deaf, Nothampton, Mass. heeft in 1933 ontdekt en aangetoond den<br />samenhang tusschen de influenza-epidemie, die gedurende 1918 in de Zuide-<br />lijke Staten heerschte en doofbeid bij kinderen. Gegevens zijn verzameld van<br />16 Amerikaansche scholen voor dooven; geboortedatums van 7247 blanke<br />‘kinderen werden verkregen, terwijl tevens uit andere bronnen werd geput.<br />Een graphiek geeft het aantal kinderen aan, geboren in eik half jaar van<br />1906 tot en met 1925; het gemiddelde aantal geboorten per half jaar bedroeg<br />200, het maximum, 267, uitgezonderd in het tweede halve jaar van 1918, toen<br />536 kinderen werden geboren. Deze sterke stijging werd in hoofdzaak in de scholen<br />der Zuidelijke staten waargenomen. Het algemeene geboortecijfer is in de genoemde<br />periode het zelfde. De studie geeft voorts tabellen met vergelijkingen per maand<br />in de jaren 1917—1919, de ligging der scholen (Noordelijke en Zuidelijke staten),<br />en gegevens omtrent blindheid bij kinderen. Men moet aannemen, dat de ziekte<br />alleen invloed op het gehoor had bij kinderen, die jonger waren dan 4 maanden<br /><br />ten tijde der epidemie. De doofheidcijfers op de scholen in de Noordelijke staten .<br /><br />geven geen aanleiding tot opmerkingen, deze waren normaal; op blindheid blijkt<br />de influenza-epidemie geen bijzonderen invloed te hebben gehad.

      "abstractNote": "Since the first constructions of alcoholism and drug addiction in the 19th century concepts of heredity have played an important role in framing substance use and abuse. In the linkage of alcoholism and drug addiction to themes of hereditary defects and biological and racial degeneration the often supposed dichotomy between “medical” and “moral” views of substance abuse was transcended. An analysis of alcoholism and hereditary health in Dutch medical discourses from 1900 until the end of the Second World War shows that the medicalization-moralization dichotomy fails to explain the complexity of historical dynamics around alcoholism and addiction. The discourses show a prevalence of a perspective of “biologization” (instead of strictly medical thoughts and practices) that closely follows German discourses. In the interwar period the rise of Mendelian genetics challenges the idea that alcohol poisons the hereditary material, leading to racial degeneration. Another conceptualization developed, in which alcoholism and drug addiction were seen not as cause but as the expression of a more general psychopathological hereditary condition. Though clearly having a medical condition, alcoholics and other addicts were also subjected to moral judgment. Different prevention options were discussed including sterilization and segregation, but political support for putting these options in practice was insufficient.",
