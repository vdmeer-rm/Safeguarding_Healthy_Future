**Notes**
Report on maternity help from 1962 with reflections on the past decade. This is a valuable source on the scale of maternity help and the (decentral) organisation on the level of the province. It shows which cross societies have been active and suggest that this is the result of “historical development”. Also interesting, the report shows that in rural areas these cross societies and “organised maternity help” was more active than in city areas. This can be explained by the active hospitals in the city. Includes some maps of maternity houses in the province.
