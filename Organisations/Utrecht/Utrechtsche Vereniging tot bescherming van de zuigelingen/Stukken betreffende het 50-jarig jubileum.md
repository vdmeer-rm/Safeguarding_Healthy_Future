**Notes**
- Also in 1960, a reception was organised to celebrate the 50-year university. The archive contains a lot of organizational documents.
- An expidition called "Het kind in het gezin" was organised. Emphasising the importance of [[The importance of the family to care for infants is plays an important role in thinking about who is responsible for child health]] rather than [[In the interwar period, the mother played a crucial part in securing child health. Interventions were directed toward mothers, fathers are absent in debates about children.]] as locus of care.
- One of the fascinating (and scanned) items is a speech, held during the celebration by [[C.J.W. Frijlink]]. Points out the importance of [[It is important to keep a close eye on the kind of problems giving meaning to issues relating to child health.]], changing the emphasis from [[physical health]] to [[mental health]]. And also raised the issues involved with growing [[complexity]] of the world, as well as [[specialisation]]. The [[The Netherlands has a unique reputation and position with respect to the organisation and success of public health.]] is also observed by the speech giver. Also interesting conclusion: "Als eindconclusie zou ik willen zeggen dat d ewijze waarop d ekinderhygiÃ«ne in Nederladn wordt uitgeoefend en die in hoofdzaak berust op de zelfwerkzaamheid en vrijwillige medewerking van de bevolking, de beste resultaten heeft opgeleverd en, in vergelijking met andere landen, binnen een zeer redelijk kostenpeil."
- The newspaper articles within the archive show the constant financial pressure (although portrayed more urgent than during the 40th anniverary). The rhetoric used to legitimize infant care is quite interesting. Especially because the internationally unique situation of organising public health through civil society is discussed, as well as the discussion that parents are responsible for care of children.
