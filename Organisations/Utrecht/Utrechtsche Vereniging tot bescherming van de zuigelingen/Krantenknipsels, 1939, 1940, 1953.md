**Notes**
This collection of newspaper articles includes some adds to require financial aid from “particulieren.” But the really interesting articles contain valuable insights in what happens within the consultation bureaus. I like the article in Utrechts Nieuwsblad (1 nov 1939) what happens inside consultation offices, and how they collaborate with maternity clincis and GPs. Other 1939 article shows how this work is constantly under (financial thread). {scans} Several newspapers include a fascinating political discussion on the raise of municipal funding of “Vereniging Moeder en Kind” [[Utrechtsche Vereniging tot Berscherming van de Zuigelingen]] – raising budget is legitimised by dividing the consultationbureaus over the city, the [[gemeentebestuur Utrecht]] also requires close collaboration with the [[Groene Kruis Utrecht]]. It is also fascinating that the city council apparently sees itself as “negotiating” with the association. Another article shows how the municipal services are portrayed as ‘intermediair’ between patient and association. Inventory also includes. Mentioning of a mobile consultationbureau in 1952.
