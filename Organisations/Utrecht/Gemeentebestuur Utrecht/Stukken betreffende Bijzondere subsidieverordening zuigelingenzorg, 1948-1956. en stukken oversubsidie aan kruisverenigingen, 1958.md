**Notes**
- These internal document enable tracing the discussion about the subsidy preconditions archived in [[Stukken betreffende de controle van de jaarstukken van de Utrechtse Vereniging tot Bescherming van Zuigelingen in verband met het verstrekken van subsidie over 1947-1954]].
- Based on these documents it is shown that the [[Wit-Gele Kruis Utrecht]] initially did not conduct home visits, but after thinking about the subsidy preconditions in general the municipality decided to make the subsidy depended on home visits - as was the case with the  [[Utrechtsche Vereniging tot Berscherming van de Zuigelingen]]. This, according to these minutes, was intended to stimulate the [[Wit-Gele Kruis Utrecht]] to conduct home visits. Shows that [[In 1950s and 1960s the municipalities forced collaboration and coordination zuigelingenzorg through subsidy policies]]
- One report quite explicitly indicate how child health care in general was geen as important for public health - early care benefitted later health.
- Contains memo also shows the disered intentions to collaborate in setting op consultation offices.
- Contains letter indicating that - as of 1953 - the director of the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Utrecht]] had to approve whether a new consultation office [[CB Nolenstraat]] could be initiated. This rule was implemented to coordinate the spread of consultation bureaus accross the city.
	- A reply to this letter from [[Wit-Gele Kruis Utrecht]] and [[Oranje-Groene Kruis Utrecht]] shows that a report had been made to indicate the population development of Utrecht to decide and plan new consultation bureaus accross the city. This report had been discussed with the head inspector of public health. I should find this report #todo shows that [[In 1950s and 1960s the municipalities forced collaboration and coordination zuigelingenzorg through subsidy policies]]
- Also indicates that reports and statistics about the activities and nurses had been sent to [[Afdeling Maatschappelijke gelegenheden en Statisiek]] - maybe look into this!
