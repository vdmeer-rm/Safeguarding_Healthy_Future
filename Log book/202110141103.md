Time start: 11.00
Location: [[Het Utrechts Archief]]
Tasks: I want to put my earlier notes in Obsidion, investigate the anniversary archives of [[Utrechtsche Vereniging tot Berscherming van de Zuigelingen]], look into the consultation offices, and figure out a planning.

- I put all my scans in Zotero.
- I have included my earlier archival notes in Obsidian.
- I investigated all the anniversary activities of the [[Utrechtsche Vereniging tot Berscherming van de Zuigelingen]].
- I explored the minutes and correspondance. The minutes are quite unreadable, or - at least take a lot of work without a clear payoff.
- The correspondence is stored for the years 1950-1965. This contains A LOT of information. Valuable to look into the historical relationship and inner workings of the consultation bureaus.

Next step would be to look into the Green Cross and Green-Orange Cross.
- Provinciale kruisverenigingen Utrecht (300)
- Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige Dienst (852)
