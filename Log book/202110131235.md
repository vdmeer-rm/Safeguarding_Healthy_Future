Location: Utrechts Archief
Tasks: Today I have the plan to further explore the archive of the [[Utrechtsche Vereniging tot Berscherming van de Zuigelingen]] and also set up a workflow in Obsideon that works for now.

I first stumbeld on a thick pack of minutes in the archive of the [[Utrechtsche Vereniging tot Berscherming van de Zuigelingen]] called [[Ingekomen en minuten van uitgegane stukken, 1918, 1950-1953]]. This is a great source to figure out in great detail how between 1950 and 1953, the organisation worked, especially in relation to the municipality. This is something to do later. I also explored and scanned the [[Jaarverslagen 1911-1965]]. These contain valuable quantitaive information and show the local organisation of the consultation offices. Lastly, I explored [[Stukken betreffende het 25-jarig jubileum, 1935]] - containing a nice impression of newspapers and photos of the early days (as in 25 years) of the consultation officies.

Would be good to look into this later.
