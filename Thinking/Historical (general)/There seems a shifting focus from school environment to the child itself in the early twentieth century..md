this is mentioned rather superficiously in [[Hart - 1999 - Een Eisch van Dringende Noodzakelijkheid]]. However, I do think that this shift is better explained by a focus from [[There might be a development from mechanisms of discipline to mechanisms of security observable.]] in that now the body of children are manged as part of the environment, and really as normalised individual bodies.
