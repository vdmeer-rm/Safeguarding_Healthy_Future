The importance of the family to care for infants is plays an important role in thinking about who is responsible for child health. This emphasis differs from highlighting [[In the interwar period, the mother played a crucial part in securing child health. Interventions were directed toward mothers, fathers are absent in debates about children.]].

- Clearly observed in the 1960s in exhibition seen in [[Stukken betreffende het 50-jarig jubileum]]
- [[C.J.W. Frijlink]] mentions this point during his speech, emphasising that responsibility of child health lies at the family: practically and financially. In the latter, the governement (not only charity) could play a role.
