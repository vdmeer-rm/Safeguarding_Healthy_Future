### Notes

This most certainly was the case in Rotterdam. Here, [[Stichting Samenwerkende Kruisverenigingen Rotterdam (SSKR)]] felt threatened by physicians from [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Rotterdam]] gezondheidscentra to start consultation offices. A deal was made that these physicians were supervised by [[Stichting Samenwerkende Kruisverenigingen Rotterdam (SSKR)]] - an agremeent about this collaboration was made in 1983.
