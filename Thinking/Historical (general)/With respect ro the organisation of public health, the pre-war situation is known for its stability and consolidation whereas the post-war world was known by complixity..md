This complexity was known by the following developments, as stated by [[Lieburg - 1994 - De geschiedenis van de Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdienst te Rotterdam, 1919-1994]] on p. 72
- [[After WW2, health care become more accessible due to reform in insurance laws]]
- [[After WW2, a lot of new medical developments (notably antibiotics) changed health care deeply.]]
- [[In the middle of the 20th century, the dominant medical model changed from being preventive-holistic to reductionistic-somatic.]]
- [[After WW2, the medical profession specialised and professionalised extensively.]]

According to [[Lieburg - 1994 - De geschiedenis van de Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdienst te Rotterdam, 1919-1994]], this also explains why it took so long to construct the [[1956 Gezondheidswet]].
