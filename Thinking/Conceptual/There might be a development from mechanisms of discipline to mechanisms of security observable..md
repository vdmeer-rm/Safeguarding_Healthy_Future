From [[Foucault - 1977 - Security, Territory, Population, 1977-1978]], it is clear that this goes along with [[There might be a shift in a focus on individual bodies, to a population.]]

I would moreover be very interested in finding out whether this shift correlated with:
- [[Health professionals involved in child health intervention had big influence on determining bodily normality.]]
- [[Health professionals involved in child health intervention had big influence on determining bodily normality.]]
- [[In the interwar period, the mother played a crucial part in securing child health. Interventions were directed toward mothers, fathers are absent in debates about children.]]
- [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]]
