[[Gezondheidscentrum Rotterdam-Ommoord]] was the most important source of inspiration. Later, in 1976, [[Gezondheidscentrum Randweg]] was founded. Important to note that these centres already existed during the 1960s and were put under the coordination of the municipal health services. A PhD disseration under supervision of [[Lambertus Burema]] could potentially shed light on how these centers operated. #todo
