This is, I think, to a big extent very much perceived and a central facet of the self image of the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] and certainly of [[Louis Heijermans]]. However, is *Gemeentelijke Gezondheidszorg Amsterdam* from 1929 is the best proof of this statement.
