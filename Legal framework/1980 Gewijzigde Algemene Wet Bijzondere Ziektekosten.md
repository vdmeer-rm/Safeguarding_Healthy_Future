### Notes

From [[Bertens - 2021 - Liberal Solidarity]]:

> “Most significant from the perspective of governmentality shifts with regard to private and public provision of health care was the way in which in 1980 the extramural care provided through the Cross Associations came to be financed through the [[1980 Gewijzigde Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]].” (Bertens, 2021, p. 200)

Ah! So the AWBZ meant the end of the power of cross societies?
		Well, not exactly, the case of Utrecht in extramural care (see: [[Maatschappelijke gezondheidszorg Reorganisatie en fusie in de gezinsverzorging - reorganisatie, fusie, 1985-1987]]) is a good example.

> “These associations, which twenty years before had still been the exemplars of ‘private initiative’ in health care – though they had become increasingly dependent on government subsidies, as we have seen – under increasing financial pressure saw the benefit of officially being brought into the governmentally mandated insurance scheme. Veder-Smit managed to have a motion to that effect passed in 1979, and on January 1, 1980, the ‘Crosses’ came within the fold of Veldkamp’s broad national insurance. In terms of governmentality, this was a significant shift, as what had been the pinnacle of ‘private initiative’ in (public) health care arrangements for decades now became part of the national scheme of distributing funds for long-term care.144” (Bertens, 2021, p. 200)
