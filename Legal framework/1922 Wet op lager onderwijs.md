### Notes

It is interesting that according to Kerkhoff, school physicians tried to keep their activities outside of municipal involvement, or involvement of health services. This could explain why the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] involved the school physicians at a relatively late stage. This can also be explained because only with the [[1922 Wet op lager onderwijs]], school phsycians were not a part of the ministry of education, but part of public health and labour.
