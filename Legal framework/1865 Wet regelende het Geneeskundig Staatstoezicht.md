### Notes

“public health be furthered by a State Medical Board, but by a new, central, authority: that of the State Medical Supervision.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 47)

“First, the primary task of the new inspectorate was to safeguard and improve public, not individual health.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 47)

“0 Monitoring the conduct of individual doctors or the welfare of individual patients would go beyond the primary task of creating stable conditions at a state or population level” (Bertens, 2021, p. 47)

“supporting the [...] unemployed, private initiative and the persons involved apparently came to see this as a government task, for which public poor relief bore responsibility in the absence of other organizations.”92 This bearing of responsibility for health care expressed itself especially in two areas: the rapid growth of municipal health services from the 1910s onwards, and the way in which local government started to radically subsidize access to hospital care in this period.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 94)
