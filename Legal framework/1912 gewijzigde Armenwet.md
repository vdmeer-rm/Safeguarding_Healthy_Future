> “In the revision, the criterion of ‘absolute necessity’ was abandoned. This had an important effect on the way in which municipalities could expand their responsibilities in taking care for the destitute.89 Moreover, a change in wording testified to a subtle but important shift in the intent of the law: ‘support’ of the poor was now changed into ‘care’ for the poor.90” (Bertens, 2021, p. 93)
