### Notes


> “With the [[1968 Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]], and the legislative work of Veldkamp more generally, the gradual growth of a legal discourse on the right to health care and the actual governmental practice of expanding access to it since the 1912 Poor Law came together both ideologically and practically.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 178)


From [[Bertens - 2021 - Liberal Solidarity]]:

> “The reality of the government taking a social interest – with both central and local government increasingly subsidizing or organizing health care arrangements – was, at long last, complemented by a new discourse or rhetoric of health care as a human right and a responsibility of the collective – now interpreted more and more as the government, and less in terms of (religious) social collectives.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 178)

> “Firstly, the [[1968 Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]] changed the financing of the system of long-term care in important ways. Before the act, governmental subsidies towards financing such types of care were delivered through (initially) the [[1912 gewijzigde Armenwet]], and then the General Act on Financial Assistance of 1965. The administration of both acts had been a matter for municipal governments. Only with the latter law had the central government become directly implicated, as it now had to retrospectively reimburse municipalities” (Bertens, 2021, p. 179)

> “But with the AWBZ, the municipal middleman was cut out. The various types of funds financing the AWBZ went directly to a newly created General Fund for Exceptional Medical Expenses, which fell under the Minister of Social Affairs. And ostensibly, in the scheme of the AWBZ the health care ‘field’ still had a serious role to play, as the General Fund was managed by the Sickness Fund Council.58” (Bertens, 2021, p. 179)

> “Secondly, the AWBZ gave off an unequivocal signal: from now on, access to certain expensive types of health care would be guaranteed by the government” (Bertens, 2021, p. 179)

> “The third and final element concerned perhaps the most visible exercise of governmental power under the new act. Much like the Sickness Funds Decree had first given the government power over the sickness funds through its setting, by decree, of admission requirements (in order for sickness funds to act as carriers for the new insurance), the AWBZ introduced requirements for providers of health care on the one hand and for insurers on the other.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 180)

> “From now on, any health care institution which wanted to apply for offering AWBZ-care had to get approval through the Sickness Fund Council.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 180)

> “This gave government the first real instrument for quality control of health care institutions.64” (Bertens, 2021, p. 180)
