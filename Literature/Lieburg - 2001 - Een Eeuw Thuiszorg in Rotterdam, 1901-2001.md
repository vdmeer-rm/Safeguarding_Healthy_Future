## Reading notes

## Part 1

**[chapter 1]**
It is truly fascinating to see how [[armenzorg]] in context of the [[1854 Armenwet]] and [[1870 Gewijzigde Armenwet]] lied in hands of the Churches. Rotterdam was predominantly *protestants-hervormd*  (p. 19).

**[chapter 2]**
Hospitals played an important role in district nursing, as coordinating fascilities. [[The early history of cross societies is tied with the history of hospital care.]] District nursing in Rotterdam arose from the [[Coolsingelziekenhuis]] at which the [[Rode Kruis Rotterdam]] started its district nursing housing and education. From 1891, cross societies could apply for a district nurse for its members. The organisation of district nursing through the [[Coolsingelziekenhuis]] failed because of the lack of popularity and loyalty to the organising committee (Lieburg, p.34)

**[chapter 3]**

*Green Cross:*
In the early history of extramural care, the [[Zuid-Hollandsche Vereeniging het Groene Kruis]] and [[Groene Kruis Rotterdam]] played a pivotal role - it had several department in different districts of the city. Especially [[Josph Philip Elias]] played a central role as board member of different associations. He was espcecially focussed on child health intervention and a GP. Also Also [[K. de Snoo]] was a chair of this association (and also of the provincial [[Zuid-Hollandsche Vereeniging het Groene Kruis]].

[[Josph Philip Elias]] founded the [[wijkgebouwen]] as centre of preventive care. Called these:

> 'monumenten van burgerzin en gemeenschapsbesef der bevolking' (Van Lieburg, p. 59)

The history of the lending care supplies was coordinated from several places: see history at p. 59. Especially important: [[CB Ijsselmonde]] as innovation.

*White-yellow cross*
[[M.H. Bouwdijk]] was a steering figure in connecting all different organisations. In van Lieburg, the yellow-white cross is portrayed as mainly focssed on genereal health.

**[Chapter 4]**
Also argues [[In the first half of the 20th century, child mortality was an important reason to infer in child health.]] Interesting that van Lieburg identies this action as follows. On the one hand, [[Child health intervention took shape in education of mothers and professionalisation of child health care.]] On the other hand, [[Child health intervention took shape by health resources to excecute child health.]] [[Bakerzorg]] and [[Kraamhulp]]  formed the pivotal role in [[maternatiy help]]. Proper education for *bakers* did failed to institutionalise.

Interesting for Rotterdam is that [[Zuid-Hollandsche Vereeniging het Groene Kruis]] installed a committee with [[Josph Philip Elias]] and [[K. de Snoo]] in 1909. Mentioning a report with goal:
> 'om te onderzoeken wat het Groene Kruis kon doen met het sterftecijfer der zuigelingen te verlagen.' (p. 77)

This was the reson to form the permanent [[Commissie voor Kraamvrouwen-verzorging en Zuigelingenbescherming]] in 1910. goal was:
> 'Welke ten doel hadden betere inzichten te verspreiden omtrent de verzorin van moeder en kind' (p.77)

This gave rise to [[Moedercursussen]]  on quite a massive scale. Accoring to [[K. de Snoo]] in 1925:
> 'de oude baker in Zuid-Holland zoo goed als verdwenen is'

The [[Rotterdamsche Vereeniging en Wijkbakerdienst]] and [[Rotterdamsche Vereeniging tot Bescherming van de Zuigelingen]] increasingly collaborated in the 1920s. 

==**Infant care in Rotterdam**==

[[In the 19th century, infant care was mainly organised through hospitals.]] In rotterdam, this was the department of nursing (polikliniek) of [[Sophia Kinderziekenhuis]]. central figure was [[E. Teixera de Mattos]] who was an activist on founding consultation offices.

Also central was founding [[HygiÃ«nische Melkstal De Vaan]] as a place of controlled baby milk production in 1909. The director of [[Sophia Kinderziekenhuis]] was also one of the founders. 

The foundation of [[Rotterdamsche Vereeniging tot Bescherming van de Zuigelingen]] was inspired by [[Nederlandsche Bond zuigelingen tot Bescherming van Zuigelingen]]. Founders had been [[C. Nolen]], [[G.H. Moll van Charante]], and [[A.A. Heijmans van den Bergh]]. They founded the first consultation office [[CB Goudschesingel 239]] in 1910 with a physician and a nurse. Focus was a [[weegbureau]], [[Moedercursussen]], and [[melkkeuken]].

This caused competion with [[Sophia Kinderziekenhuis]] (indication: [[Competition within the medical profession played an important driver for organisational change.]]). competion on charity as well as municipal support. This was stopped by [[Johannes Elias Feisser]], who directed as director of [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Rotterdam]] a merge [[Zuigelingenkliniek Rotterdam]] and [[Sophia Kinderziekenhuis]] - leading to [[Kinderziekenhuis aan de Gordelweg]] in 1934.

However, the [[Rotterdamsche Vereeniging tot Bescherming van de Zuigelingen]] started to focus on extramural care with its second consultation office [[CB Linker Maasoever]] in 1913. [[In the 1920s, the Rotterdamsche Vereeniging tot Bescherming van de Zuigelingen became the coordinating association to come up with an efficient network of consultation offices.]] The following were founded:
- [[CB G.J. Mulderstraat]] in 1921
- [[CB Maashaven ]] in 1922
- [[CB 1e Pijnackerstraat]] in 1923
- [[CB Brink]] in 1927
- [[CB Dreef]] in 1939
- [[CB van Lennepstraat]] in 1928
- [[CB Roemer Visscherstraat]] in 1938
- [[CB Gouwstraat]] in 1930

The [[Vereeniging Roomsch Katholieke Kraamverzorging]], founded in 1917 was the other key player. Had consultation bureaus:
- [[CB Goudschensingel 203&206]] in 1930 under direction of [[H.A.C. Schaaf]].
- [[CB Afrikaanderplein 3]]
- [[CB Robert Fruinstraat 36]]

## part 2
**[chapter 5]**
Also in rotterdam: [[In 1950s and 1960s the municipalities forced collaboration and coordination zuigelingenzorg through subsidy policies]]. 
- [[Rotterdamsche Vereeniging tot Bescherming van de Zuigelingen]] and [[Groene Kruis Rotterdam]] merged in 1955
- With a focus on three cross societies: [[Oranje-Groene Kruis Rotterdam]], [[Groene Kruis Rotterdam]], [[Wit-Gele Kruis Rotterdam]]. They collaborated on acquiring members (what does this mean?? #todo) and with [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Rotterdam]]. For this cuase [[contactorgaan Rotterdam]] and later (in 1955)[[Kruisraad Rotterdam]] was founded. In  1940s, attempts coordinate in districts failed.

In 1953, the alderman [[Gemeentebestuur Rotterdam]] required cross societes to include infant health, according to Van Lieburg (p. 96). I actually think that this was the result of [[1952 Subsidieregeling voor Kruisverenigingen]], and parallels [[From 1954, the Municipality of Utrecht tried to coordinate child health intervention in alignment with local and regional governments.]]

[[In 1955 the Rotterdam Cross Societies closed a deal with ziekenfondsen - insured automatically became member.]]  Caused a lot of competition on members. Would btw be curious to see how this was influenced by religion.

[[In the 1950s and 1960s, religion played implicitly an organisational role in organising preventive child health intervention. Explicitly this role was denied in a national level.]] In the[[Kruisraad Rotterdam]] a lot of discussion took place whether "non-confessional" tasks could be centralised. According to Van Lieburg (p.100) - it was unclear where the difference lied.

Two developments appeared to be crucial in starting the debate on merges of cross societies in Rotterdam. On the one hand member of parliament and Rotterdam physician [[J.H. Lamberts]] recommended cross societies to merge in 1968 (did not get support in parliament). And on the other hand, the succesfull foundation of the [[Stichting Samenwerkende Amsterdamse Kruisverenigingen]] in 1966. Alderman [[G.D. de Vos]] decided to forse the members of the [[Kruisraad Rotterdam]] to merge. This happend [[In 1950s and 1960s the municipalities forced collaboration and coordination zuigelingenzorg through subsidy policies]] Also in Rotterdam, the [[Oranje-Groene Kruis Rotterdam]] was strongly against collaboration. Very much comparable to [[Oranje-Groene Kruis Utrecht]] in the same period. Nevertheless, in 1972, the [[Stichting Samenwerkende Rotterdamsche Kruisverenigingen]]

The [[1974 Structuurnota]] made the [[Stichting Samenwerkende Kruisverenigingen Rotterdam (SSKR)]] more independent from provincial cross socities. This process was fastened with the [[1980 Gewijzigde Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]], meaning that [[Ziekenfonds Rotterdam]]

In 1989, strategic policy had the consequence that [[Stichting Samenwerkende Kruisverenigingen Rotterdam (SSKR)]] wanted to create a [[gezondheidsnetwerk]]. The Stichting:
> 'stelt zich tot doel zijn activiteiten bij voorkeur smaen met andere zorginstellingen onder te brengen in een gezondheidsnetwerk in Rotterdam en Omgeving. Dit betekent ten behoeve van de functie het zo draaglijk mogelijk maken of houden van ongezondheid en nauwe samenwerking dan wel fusie van onderdelen van onze organisatie met thuishulp, verzorgingstehuizen, veprleeghuizen, dienstencentra, en organisaties die hulpmiddelen/verpleegartikelen leveren.' (p. 110)

This happened in 1990 as [[Stichting Thuiszorg Rotterdam]].

[[In the 1990s, Cross societies of major cities were increasingly confronted with budget cuts and decided to collaborate in making a case to better divide funding for home care.]] This had success for Rotterdam - as it lead to a higher budget.

[chapter 8]
After the merger of [[Groene Kruis Rotterdam]] and [[Rotterdamsche Vereeniging tot Bescherming van de Zuigelingen]] in 1955, the nurses could choose for which Cross association they were going to work. This caused a lot of rivalry, especially because the [[Groene Kruis Rotterdam]] focussed on the enitre city with an independent department on infant care.

Also in Rotterdam, the distinction between [[Specifieke Zusters]] ([[Groene Kruis Utrecht]]) and [[Polyvalente Zusters]] ([[Wit-Gele Kruis Rotterdam]] and [[Oranje-Groene Kruis Utrecht]]) was prevalent. This caused a lot of overlap. The [[Stichting Samenwerkende Kruisverenigingen Rotterdam (SSKR)]] was very painful for nurses on a local level.

[[In the first half of the 20th century, head physicians of consultation offices changes jobs quickly because salaries did not compete.]] This was, in Rotterdam at least, solved by higher salaries, in 1979.

[[In 1970s, Rotterdam started organising the longitudinal child care, requiring school physicians and infant care to integrate]]

[[In the 1980s, municipal health centres and consultation offices of cross societies started to integrate.]]This most certainly was the case in Rotterdam. Here, [[Stichting Samenwerkende Kruisverenigingen Rotterdam (SSKR)]] felt threatened by physicians from [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Rotterdam]] gezondheidscentra to start consultation offices. A deal was made that these physicians were supervised by [[Stichting Samenwerkende Kruisverenigingen Rotterdam (SSKR)]] - an agremeent about this collaboration was made in 1983.

For developments in the 1980s, the [[1978 Rapport Uitgangspunten en Beleidsaanbevelingen voor de jeugdgezondheidszorg in het Kruiswerk]] by the [[Nationale Kruisvereniging (NK)]] was constituitive for historical development. The [[Afdeling Moeder en Kindzorg SSKR]] van [[Stichting Samenwerkende Kruisverenigingen Rotterdam (SSKR)]] decided to clarify the professional relations within mother and child care. After the merger and resulting [[Stichting Thuiszorg Rotterdam]], a special deparment 'Ouder Kind Zorg' took over these task with 'districtsmanagers'. 

In the middle of the 1980s, [[Afdeling Moeder en Kindzorg SSKR]] determined its goals as:
> 'het bevorderen, beveiligen en begeleiden van de gezondheid, groei, en ontwikkeling van het kind, zowel in somatische als psychosociale zin.' p.162

Did whatever described in [[Consultatiebureau]], but it [[complexity]] increased. This cage the urgency of a general script for consultation office care, following how [[In the 1970s, examanination was 'hardened' and standardised.]] Moreover, the [[Nederlands Instituut voor Kinderstudie]] proposed using the [[Groeiboekje]] in 1980. This succeeded the [[blauwe boekje]].

I should also look into [[jeugdland]], organised between 1958 and 1993. - [ ]  #todo

 [[Pedagogisch Consultatiebureau]] was founded in rotterdam in 1958 with nurses from [[Stichting Samenwerkende Kruisverenigingen Rotterdam (SSKR)]] With [[Stichting Thuiszorg Rotterdam]], this [[Pedagogisch Consultatiebureau]] was terminated.
