## Reading notes
‘T Hart indicates that school physicians were installed because of the calls from Dutch hygiënists in the late 19th century, afraid of bad miasma (Hart, 1999, pp. 9-10). This is a bit odd, since health profesionals were already debating vertical or horizontal translation.

‘T Hart states that before the second world war, the focus of school physicians lied in prevention infectious disease. Only after the WWII, focus shifted towards improving bodily, mental, and social well-being (Hart, 1999, p. 10). [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]]

‘T Hart presents his book as an analysis of the growth and expansion of the “demand for physical and mental well-being” (Hart, 1999, p. 14).

Some historiographical positioning:

> Wie een grondig overzicht verwacht van bestuurlijke en administratieve aangelegenheden, komt daarom bedrogen uit. Datzelfde geldr voor degene die in deze geschiedenis in de eerste plaats de neerslag zoekt van wetenschappelijke ontwikkelingen in de kindergeneeskunde en de sociale geneeskunde. De nadruk ligt veeleer op sociaal-historische aspecten (Hart, 1999, p. 15).

[Chapter 1]

‘T Hart argues that as a result of the conceptual transition from miasma to contagious explanation of infectious disease, focus of intervention shifted from the school environment to the children themselves (Hart, 1999, p. 21). This indicates that [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]] goes hand in hand with [[There seems a shifting focus from school environment to the child itself in the early twentieth century.]]

‘T Hart shows the importance of the growth of school-going children as result of [[1901 leerplicht]] and the resulting growth of pupils (Hart, 1999, p. 23). This is later phrased as follows:

> De druk op de overheid werd groter toen de leerplicht van kracht geworden was. Zo beschouwd was hun komst _een natuurlijke en noodzakelijke consequentie van den leerplicht_ maar wel met een lange voorgeschiedenis (Hart, 1999, p. 29).

[chapter 2]

In the early twentieth century (around 1905) primarily **teachers** were worried about the conditions of children, with respect to nutrition, exercise, disease, en mental well-being. It is fascinating that physicians, apparently, were too busy. Inspection - both on a national and local-municipal scale - was lacking due to too much work (Hart, 1999, p. 26).

Physicians saw - as always - opportunities in school physicians - especially, because the early twentieth century knew quite some competition in Utrecht. Not only from other general practitioners, but also from the growing number of specialists and free health care for the poor (by a “gemeente-arts” of “kerkdokter”). This situation also caused a lot of trouble for middle-class citizens, who were too rich for being poor and to poor for being rich enough to pay for a private doctor (Hart, 1999, pp. 27-8). It shows that [[Competition within the medical profession played an important driver for organisational change.]]

[chapter 3]

Chapter deals with “schoolartsenkwestie”. It is interesting that proponents saw the school physicians as the “first physician examining young children - as consultation offices were not yet installed everywhere (Hart, 1999, p. 31). [[In Utrecht, school physicians prelude infant and toddler health intervention.]]

‘T Hart mentions that school physicians would gather data on the physicial conditions of children. this would be used to determine what was normal and what was abnormal (!!), It could also be used for research or policy purposes (Hart, 1999, p. 32). [[Health professionals involved in child health intervention had big influence on determining bodily normality.]]

Opponents were worried that the sovereignty of family (esp. the father) would be contested - this was especially a worry in protestant circles. Shows that [[Criticasters of preventive child health intervention were worried that it contested sovereignty of the family.]] Also the worry about “[[state]] socialism” was omnipresent among opponents. It would also be hard from a legal point of view: school physicians could not be made mandatory for “special schools” and worries about the balance between national and municipal governments existed. (Hart, 1999, pp. 33-4) Opponents also doubted the necessity and efficacy of school physicians. ‘T Hart also suggests worries about medicalisation, and the exaggerated attention for disease. (Hart, 1999, p. 35) 

The NMG - representing “Medisch Nederland” - stated in 1896 that physicians should be part of “school commissies” and that school medicine would become part of the medical curriculum (Hart, 1999, p. 37).

[Chapter 4]

Utrecht gets its first five school physicians in 1907, young male doctors. Non-specialist (as enough polyclinics existed in the city). Three objectives: (1) children with diseases that could affect other children should not be in-class, (2) making child healthy for education, (3) inspecting health of teachers. It is interesting that [[J. H. G. Carstens]] (at the age of 24 - later one of the founders of the [[Utrechtsche Vereniging tot Berscherming van de Zuigelingen]]]) was one of the new school physicians . Interesting that Christian school did not participate because ‘parents took care’ or school physicians was ‘for the poor. (Hart, 1999, p. 43) But in reality, this shows that [[Criticasters of preventive child health intervention were worried that it contested sovereignty of the family.]]

[chapter 5]

School physicians in Utrecht were very busy, and worked reactively and proactively. Most of the time they sent children home or to a specialist. In case of an infectious disease, the school physicians visited homes proactively to check whether advise had been followed (Hart, 1999, p. 45). This indicates [[Over the course of the twentieth century, the possibilites for preventive intervention expanded.]]

Fascinating that [[J. H. G. Carstens]] started to organise school physicians on a national level, according to ‘t Hart because of the lacking expertise. He founded the “Nederlandsche Vereeniging voor Schoolartsen”, which was the reason for acknowledging school physicians as a sociaal-medical [[specialisation]] (Hart, 1999, p. 47).

‘T Hart mentions that school physicians became more effective when the municipality informed them when infectious diseases were found in specific families. School physicians also played an important role in pleading for funding for local civil initiatives that, for example, offered gymnastic excersice for poor children with scoliosis. (Hart, 1999, p. 47) This preludes [[In 1950s and 1960s the municipalities forced collaboration and coordination zuigelingenzorg through subsidy policies]]

In 1915, the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Utrecht]] was centralised under the direction of 6 municipal physicians. the city was divided in three areas, and two municiapl physicians were responsible for one area. They were responsible for school inspection, medical help for the poor, and inspection the labour force of the municiaplity. They were located in three communitiy building on the border of two area’s: at the Radiumstraat, the Wittevrouwensingel, and the Oosterkade. ‘T Hart interestingly shows that now the municipality physicians could both inspect children at school and check without “bureaucratic hassle” whether advise was followed under two different hats. For this period, this centralisation was very different as compared to other cities. (Hart, 1999, p. 48) Shows that [[Over the course of the twentieth century, the possibilites for preventive intervention expanded.]]

Also from 1918, the municipal physicians were assisted by school nurses, who also visited neighbourhoods to control whether adivise was followed (Hart, 1999, p. 52) This seems to suggest that [[The organisational model of civil and public preventive medicine was co-produced.]]

It is also interesing that general practitioners were afraid of competition, and framed their criticism as fear for interferance in family life (Hart, 1999, p. 52). [[Competition within the medical profession played an important driver for organisational change.]]

[Chapter 7]

‘t Hart sketches the response to most infectious diseases. The GG&GD played an important role in campaigns against diphtheria, it does not become clear what role school physicians played in inocculation (Hart, 1999, p. 59). Shows that [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]] In the 1920s and 1930s, school nurses visited children at home to investigate “inform” families about what to do against head lice. Later in 1941, it was mandatory to cut hair of children with head lice - measure was withdrawn after WWII. (Hart, 1999, p. 65)

[Chapter 8]

‘T Hart gets a bit more sloppy in his sketchy descriptions. He shows how “vakantiekolonies”, “kinderuitzettingen” etc. were important facet of child health interventions, and part of the dynamics of civil society, with a (minor) funding municiaplity, who tried to coordinate activities by forcing overarching organisations (such as URK - “Utrechtse Raad voor Kinderuitzetting” in 1924) to coordinate collaboration. Also an example of preluding to: [[In the 1950s and 1960s, religion played implicitly an organisational role in organising preventive child health intervention. Explicitly this role was denied in a national level.]] ‘t Hart has a lot of attention for “Paascheizakjes” in 1936 and later. He argues that medical professionals were used for selecting eligibility for deploying to “vakantiekoloniën” and that school physicians played a central rol, next to GP’s. Also interesitng is that ‘t Hart argues that these deploying activities disappeared due to WWII conditions, and more fully during the 1970s as a result of better socioeconomic living conditions. (Hart, 1999, pp. 73-75)

‘t Hart now descibed budget cuts, and the constant necessity for the GG&GD and school physicians (after the WWII, this division does not really make sense) to account for their expenses. It is fascinating that - apparently - in the 1970s and 1980s GG&GDs were asked to scrimp *because* of the existence of infant care:

> Was er wel een schoolarts nodig om vast te stellen dat een kind gezwollen tonsillen had of een hoge bloeddruk? Dankzij de uitgebreide zorg voor zuigelingen en kleuters (door kruisverenigingen, huisartsen en gezondheidscentra), werden ergelijke en grove afwijkingen al ontdekt en aangepakt voordat de kinderen naar school gingen. Wat had dan de ingangscontrole en een incidenteel bezoek van een schoolarts voor zin? In 1975 reageerde de GG&GD op zulke vragen onder met de verzekering: _“Jeugdgezondheidzorg is een veelomvattend medische specialisme waarvoor gericht getrainde artsen, verpleegkunidgen, en medisch administatieve medewerkers moeten worden ingezet.”_ (Hart, 1999, p. 77)

This indicates that [[In the 1970s the organisational success of Utrecht preventive child health action formed a serious argument for budget cuts on other public health elements.]]

[chapter 9]

This chapter is a rather eclectic reflection on the - at the time - current status of child health intervention. It touches on the necessity of collaboration on the level of the neighbourhood; the introduction of sexual health; the problems arising from raising children in an intercultural setting. On the side, ‘t Hart indicates:

> Zo is toch gebeurd wat sommigen inm het verleden vreesden: de jeugdarts draagt met zijn medewerkers normen en waarden uit en mengt zich in gezinsaangelegenhede (Hart, 1999, p. 89)

Also interesting that ‘t Hart observes that child abuse was not a part of child health intervention. It was “not mentioned in 1905” and in 1970s, “only one in 10.00 children was registered as abused” (Hart, 1999, p. 90). Is this true? Could indicate [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]]

‘t Hart indicates that one questions remains relevant for the whole period, and it is an interesting one:

> Eén probleem is onveranderd gebleven: waar moeten het geld en de mensen worden gevonden voor het werk en voor het overleg met al die gesprekspartners? (Hart, 1999, p. 92)

Shows that [[Troughout the twentieth century, the disered expansion of child health intervention could not be met with the required money and manpower, resulting in the constant experience of work pressure.]]
