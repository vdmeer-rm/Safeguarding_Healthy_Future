**Take-home message**:

Access to Dutch health care can be seen through the lense of shifting governmentalities, which is collection of ideas and proposed action to govern. It shows that whereas the Dutch central government was outspoken about refraining from top-down interference, the Dutch state (whatever that might be) was very much involved in funding health care. According to Bertens, rhetorics and practice contrasted one another troughout the twentieth century.

## Reading notes


### “Part I: Liberal Governmentality, 1848-1912 In which a Liberal governmentality for state and society is devised, and the rhetoric and reality of state absence in health care run parallel” (Bertens, 2021, p. 33)

concept note: [[Between 1848-1912, a Liberal governmentality for state and society is devised, and the rhetoric and reality of state absence in health care run parallel.]]

#### “Introduction” (Bertens, 2021, p. 34)

#### “The State of Dutch Health Care” (Bertens, 2021, p. 35)

#### “Medical Care and The Medical ‘Profession’ in the Early 19th Century” (Bertens, 2021, p. 37)

#### “Bringing Doctors under One Banner” (Bertens, 2021, p. 40)

#### “A Liberal Blueprint: the 1848 Constitution” (Bertens, 2021, p. 42)

> “When translated into a new constitution and lower legislation a few years later, these general ideas laid down the two tracks along which the Dutch nation-state would develop after 1848. On the one hand, Thorbecke’s focus on ‘self-government’ emphasized the need for limited state intervention, even if the state more than before was guided by the people’s will (though expressed by only a very marginal portion of the people, as we shall see). On the other hand, the Liberal project of enabling citizens to realize their potential and to adequately voice their interests in the political arena meant that certain preconditions for the personal development of these citizens had to be met. These two elements – a small government nevertheless providing a certain level of safeguards for the development of its citizens – would also be central to the health care legislation of 1865.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 43)

Bertens here described the combination of liberal and decentralised government, which formed the cornerstones [[Criticasters of preventive child health intervention were worried that it contested sovereignty of the family.]] This went hand in hand with [[An opposition to top-down state intervention with matters of health is an important aspect of the 20th century discourse on public health.]]

> “Tellingly, the word used by Thorbecke for the lowest level in this legal structure – ‘gemeente’ – means municipality” (Bertens, 2021, p. 43) Clever: gemeente as community and municipality

[[The municipality is the territory of child health intervention troughout the twentieth century.]]

> “in a legal sense, but can also mean ‘community’ as in a group of people or even a specific religious congregation.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 44) This is the [[verzuiling]]

#### “Health Care: A Concern for the State?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 44)

> “0 But if ‘competence and wisdom’ were necessary criteria for effective self-government, should strengthening these elements in the population not be an absolute duty for the state?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 44) Reminds to the notion of citizenship that Dutch eugenicists envision

> “The Poor Law of 1854, the Act on Public Schools of 1878, and the Labor Law of 1889 all served to combine socially progressive agendas with the removal of obstacles to self-fulfillment.42 A” (Bertens, 2021, p. 45)

> “By then, legislation pertaining to health care had come to be seen as important to the notion of ‘self-realization’, as infectious disease and unhealthy living conditions clearly created obstacles for citizens to realize their true potential in actively partaking in communal life.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 45)

#### “Setting the Boundaries: The Laws of 1865” (Bertens, 2021, p. 45)

> “Thorbecke’s vision with regard to health care produced four laws, which together espoused three principles: quality, equality and governmental supervision of health care at the local level.43” (Bertens, 2021, p. 45)
> “3 For this analysis I lean heavily on F. Huisman, ‘Ziek en gezond in het huis van Thorbecke’, (forthcoming article). See also: Aerts, Thorbecke wil het, 598-601; D.J. Wolffram, Vrij van wat neerdrukt en beklemt. Staat, gemeenschap, sociale politiek, 1870-1918 (Amsterdam: Wereldbibliotheek 2003) 38-39, 45-49.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 45)

> “However, despite serious debate in Parliament as to the effectiveness of imposing uniformity on a group of professionals of such dissimilar backgrounds and education, Thorbecke’s laws passed, officially creating the medical ‘class’ and profession which had been foreshadowed by the founding of the Dutch Medical Association.45” (Bertens, 2021, p. 46)

> “During the Parliamentary debates, the full import of these laws was lost on no one: what they in effect created was a monopoly on the practice of (academic) medicine and pharmacology. S” (Bertens, 2021, p. 46)

“48 [[1865 Wet regelende het Geneeskundig Staatstoezicht]] (Staatsblad no. 58).” (Bertens, 2021, p. 46) 

> “No longer would quality control and public health be furthered by a State Medical Board, but by a new, central, authority: that of the State Medical Supervision.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 47)

> “First, the primary task of the new inspectorate was to safeguard and improve public, not individual health.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 47)

> “0 Monitoring the conduct of individual doctors or the welfare of individual patients would go beyond the primary task of creating stable conditions at a state or population level” (Bertens, 2021, p. 47)

#### “A New Governmentality for Health Care” (Bertens, 2021, p. 48)

> “In terms of formal ‘governance’ arrangements, several medical professions had received official recognition and protection by the state through the monopoly created by the Acts on the Practice of Medicine and Pharmacy [[1865 Wet regelende het Geneeskundig Staatstoezicht]]. In return, they had to begin meeting standards of uniform education and practice, and would have to furnish State Inspectors with mortality statistics in order to arrive at a better understanding of developments in public health, which for the first time created a link between the national government and private medical professionals. T” (Bertens, 2021, p. 48)

> “This governmentality, as well as the general emphasis on minimal state intervention would stay dominant for a long time, because notions of subsidiarity, self-governance and ‘sphere sovereignty’ would become the cornerstones of new political parties arising in the decades after Thorbecke. I” (Bertens, 2021, p. 49)

This aspect remained important until the [[ontzuiling]] in the 1980s, underpinning [[Criticasters of preventive child health intervention were worried that it contested sovereignty of the family.]] and [[An opposition to top-down state intervention with matters of health is an important aspect of the 20th century discourse on public health.]].

#### “Programmatic Laws, Stubborn Realities” (Bertens, 2021, p. 49)

> ““While Thorbecke’s health care legislation was of great value to the professionalization of medicine, regulating public health was still a matter for local government.”52” (Bertens, 2021, p. 49)

[[The municipality is the territory of child health intervention troughout the twentieth century.]]

> “: in the historiography, the consensus is that the State Inspectorate for Health Care founded in 1865 was mostly ineffective in the first half century of its existence.5” (Bertens, 2021, p. 49)

Well, in a practical sense. Could also debate what "effective" means.

> “But Thorbecke’s much-extolled ‘local level’ proved to be the Achilles’ heel for the new governance structure. G” (Bertens, 2021, p. 49) From the perspective of the national government indeed

#### “problem ownership” (Bertens, 2021, p. 50) There we go

> “More importantly, the new hierarchy of political communities had failed to provide a clear notion of where financing for public health measures should come from, effectively making this dependent on the checkbook and whim of individual municipalities.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 50) 

This refers to the [[1851 Gemeentewet]] and is interesting, as, indeed, local governments struggled with financial resources until at least the 1960s -- on a LOCAL level! Despite that [[An opposition to top-down state intervention with matters of health is an important aspect of the 20th century discourse on public health.]]

#### “Case Study: The State Inspectorate and the Fostering of Individual Care” (Bertens, 2021, p. 51)

#### “A Marginal Role for Government: Poor Relief and Health Care” (Bertens, 2021, p. 54)

> “In [[1854 Armenwet]] was enacted, extending the reach of government with regard to the welfare of the Dutch citizenry by providing forms of poor relief to the destitute – and creating access to some health care provisions was seen as part of this.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 54)

I would be interested in finding out from which budgets the subsidies of municipalities were comming. Would be a pain in the ass #todo 


#### “Civil Society in Action” (Bertens, 2021, p. 56)

#### “A Changing Political Landscape and a Society on the Move” (Bertens, 2021, p. 58)

> “And the ‘Liberalism’ for which Thorbecke would be remembered was more a philosophy of legal proceduralism than a political program – the state should guarantee equal rights and, in part, equal opportunities for citizens, but that would be the extent of government intervention.87” (Bertens, 2021, p. 58) 

Important for [[An opposition to top-down state intervention with matters of health is an important aspect of the 20th century discourse on public health.]].


#### “The ‘Social Question’ and Limited State Intervention” (Bertens, 2021, p. 60)

#### “Conclusion” (Bertens, 2021, p. 63)

> “All in all, the final decades of the 19th century seem to present a break with Thorbeckian handsoff governance, as The Netherlands began to show a different face in economic and social affairs, a change which called for more safeguards by the state. However, it was clear that solutions to the new and growing social problems very much bore the mark of ‘1848’. In that year, a new Liberal ‘governmentality’ had been introduced for the way the Dutch nation-state would ideally be allowed to develop and flourish, according to the main architect of the new Dutch constitution, the Liberal statesman Johan Thorbecke. T” (Bertens, 2021, p. 63)

I get that governmentality is basically the same as "political culture"

> “on what meagre municipal support there was to be had under the [[1854 Armenwet]]. All in all, Thorbecke’s focus on private initiative and ‘social force’ still underpinned much legislation on this front, although in practice such initiative often did not yet live up to the great expectations the statesman had of it in the mid-19th century. A” (Bertens, 2021, p. 64)

[[In the first half of the 20th century, civil society played a pivotal role in Dutch public health.]]

### “PPart II: Hybrid Governmentality, 1912-1968” (Bertens, 2021, p. 65)

Concept note: [[Between 1912 and 1968, the Liberal rhetoric of state abstinence is reinforced by Protestant and Catholic political philosophies, but in reality government becomes involved in the provision of health care.]]


#### “Introduction” (Bertens, 2021, p. 66)

> “The confessional parties which came into their own in this period – keeping real socialist influence at bay – stressed private initiative and sovereignty for separate (religious) groups in society” (Bertens, 2021, p. 67)

“However, from 1912 onwards, a subtle but important revision of the Poor Law [[1912 gewijzigde Armenwet]] caused these private initiatives to be supplemented in earnest by new initiatives while financing arrangements coming from local governments jumped into the gap left by a lethargic central state. Therefore, despite the fact that the arena of national politics was still dominated by confessional and Liberal factions who espoused a philosophy of state abstinence, important shifts in the financing and organization of health care were taking place ‘on the ground’. The steady growth of public arrangements had effects on what citizens came to expect from (local) government in terms of increasing access to health care.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 67)

#### “Medicine and Health Care in Transition” (Bertens, 2021, p. 67)

#### “New Promises of Medicine” (Bertens, 2021, p. 68)

#### “Great Expectations” (Bertens, 2021, p. 70)

> “Where Thorbecke’s focus on public health measures had been justified by hygienists’ and sanitarians’ emphasis on such measures as the most effective way to bring down mortality rates, the discoveries of the second half of the 19th century increasingly fed the belief in individual medicine as crucial and as more effective in combating illness and death.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 70)

I think that this is nonsense

#### “Shifting Care: New Locations” (Bertens, 2021, p. 72)

> “A parallel but less eye-catching development in The Netherlands is presented by the so-called ‘Cross Associations.’ After the turn of the century, these small, local associations mushroomed in rural areas across the country. Initially founded for fulfilling tasks in the area of public, collective health, nursing increasingly became for them a vital task. Curative interventions in the (psychiatric) hospital or specialist clinic were thus increasingly complemented by a type of care outsourced to small, local institutions financed through collective arrangements – something quite different from what would mostly have been care in the home by friends or family members before that time” (Bertens, 2021, p. 72)

Cross societies popping up "at the turn of the century" #CrossSociety It is relevant that this correlates with the first consultation bureaus in Utrecht. It really is the start of [[In the first half of the 20th century, civil society played a pivotal role in Dutch public health.]]!


> “A similar development took place with regards to the Cross Associations. The first of these had been founded by [[Jacobus Penn]], a State Inspector for Health Care who by 1875 had become so disillusioned by the lack of municipal activity in the field of public health that he decided to organize a private service in Hilversum for furthering this cause.24 In a period in which the State Inspectorate, despite its best intentions, often failed to move municipal governments in furthering public health, this formula proved to be a great success. Table 2.1 illustrates this (the numbers represent local Associations founded in each of these periods, not the grand total):” (Bertens, 2021, p. 73)

It is intersting that [[Cross Societies were founded because of a percieved gap in health care.]]

> “As time progressed and cities increasingly founded their own municipal health services (see par. 2.4), the biggest wave of growth for these Associations in rural areas passed. Still, by 1941 there was a grand total of 1335 local Cross Associations, up from a handful in the period before 1890.26” (Bertens, 2021, p. 74)

> “These associations increasingly came to be seen as the core of the sacrosanct ‘private initiative’. And yet, their budgetary needs would gradually also bring government into the equation.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 74)

Indeed: this is an example of [[In the first half of the 20th century, civil society played a pivotal role in Dutch public health.]] In this case especially the cross societies.

#### “Social Ideals, Faltering Politics” (Bertens, 2021, p. 74)

> “Especially from 1912 onwards, new public subsidies and financing arrangements led to serious shifts in influence over how health care was provided.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 76)

Being the result of the [[1912 gewijzigde Armenwet]].

#### “The Limits of the Legislature” (Bertens, 2021, p. 76)

#### “Limits of the Legislature, Act Two: Health Insurance” (Bertens, 2021, p. 79)

> “If in this period it proved hard to get central government to play a role in the private sphere where the provision of sick pay in case of illness was concerned, attempts at instituting a mandatory health insurance scheme fared even worse.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 79)

#### “The Trials of the State Inspectorate” (Bertens, 2021, p. 80)

> “The history of attempts to legislate public health perfectly illustrates the stalemate between, on the one hand, a growing support for to the notion that this was something to be stimulated or guaranteed by government, and on the other, an unwillingness and general lack of effectiveness across the political board to put either power or money into the hands of governmental bodies” (Bertens, 2021, p. 80)

Example of: [[An opposition to top-down state intervention with matters of health is an important aspect of the 20th century discourse on public health.]]

> “Despite the new organizational structure and theoretically strong position for the Health Council, it straightaway became clear that the Inspectorate was dogged by two interconnected problems: an unclear mandate, and limited effectiveness in stimulating change at the local level, caused by lack of interest and respect on the part of municipal authorities for the Inspectors and Health Committees.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 81)

> “This had turned out to be wishful thinking, as within the so-called ‘House’ set out by Thorbecke himself, municipalities were not at all keen on central government looking over their shoulder. This problem came to the fore even more prominently where it concerned the organization of public health care.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 82)

[[In the first half of the 20th century, tension between local and central government were constituitive for child health intervention.]]

#### “The Achilles’ Heel of a ‘Local’ Governmentality” (Bertens, 2021, p. 82)

> “The local Health Committees, already in existence since [[1865 Wet regelende het Geneeskundig Staatstoezicht]], were often at the receiving end of such disdain. As noted, these Committees were to have a serious role in the structure updated in . They operated under supervision of the local Inspectors, but were seen as seminal because of their proximity to municipal health policy. Nevertheless, much like the Inspectors themselves, these institutions were outsiders in the local hierarchy, as they were formally instituted by central government. Moreover, they often had enormous areas of operation: by 1903 there were 130 Health Committees, on a total of some 1100 municipalities.53” (Bertens, 2021, p. 83)

Well, these Gezondheidscommissies did have a formative role in the foundation of local municipal health services See: [[Utrechtse Gezondheidscommissie]].

#### “From Arbitrariness to Accessibility” (Bertens, 2021, p. 85)

#### “Sickness Funds: The Bedrock of Dutch Health Insurance” (Bertens, 2021, p. 86)

#### “Private Health Insurance: Lucrative or Lurid?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 89)

#### “State Intervention Through the Back Door” (Bertens, 2021, p. 92)

> “The failure of top-down government intervention can easily create the impression that civil society and private initiative were the sole compartments responsible for creating access to health care in the first half of the twentieth century. However, although the sickness funds have taken up a large share of the attention in the literature, from the perspective of public interest in (access to) health care and of governmentality, a more subtle but very significant development took place. In 1912, the Poor Law of 1854 was revised to officially give municipal governments (Thorbecke’s focal point for ‘autonomous power’) a task which they had gradually been taking over in the past two decades: the care for the poor and destitute.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 92)

Resulting in the [[1912 gewijzigde Armenwet]].  Linked to [[In the middle of the twentieth century, a strong balance between municipal and civil initiatives formed the core of public health.]] combined with [[An opposition to top-down state intervention with matters of health is an important aspect of the 20th century discourse on public health.]]

> “he increasing role of the municipality as a force for social change was oddly often not recognized as a direct increase in state power” (Bertens, 2021, p. 92)

Because it is not centralised state power. That might be an interesting question though: are we talking about centralisation when talking about the rise of the state? #todo

> “There must be a spiritual link between the poor person and his benefactor. That is why the State is not the organ for true care for the poor [...] It is therefore right that the new Poor Law does not institute state care. The mercy of the free charity of church and private persons (‘particulieren’, RB) is put first and foremost and protected and strengthened in various places. And where, at last, government should intervene, it should not be the State, but the Municipality (capitalized in original, RB).84” (Bertens, 2021, p. 92) State does not seem to be a helpful translation if it originally is refers to "Rijk".

> “Indeed, before [[1912 gewijzigde Armenwet]], the Civil Poor Boards of, amongst others, Amsterdam, Delft, Groningen and Zaandam already offered financial support alongside that of private and church institutions, a” (Bertens, 2021, p. 92)
> “practice known as ‘dubbele bedeling’ or double support.85” (Bertens, 2021, p. 93)

This important to figure out for Utrecht #todo

[[1912 gewijzigde Armenwet]]:
> “In the revision, the criterion of ‘absolute necessity’ was abandoned. This had an important effect on the way in which municipalities could expand their responsibilities in taking care for the destitute.89 Moreover, a change in wording testified to a subtle but important shift in the intent of the law: ‘support’ of the poor was now changed into ‘care’ for the poor.90” (Bertens, 2021, p. 93) 

> “supporting the [...] unemployed, private initiative and the persons involved apparently came to see this as a government task, for which public poor relief bore responsibility in the absence of other organizations.”92 This bearing of responsibility for health care expressed itself especially in two areas: the rapid growth of municipal health services from the 1910s onwards, and the way in which local government started to radically subsidize access to hospital care in this period.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 94)

#### “Local Government Steps In” (Bertens, 2021, p. 94)

> “ced with a lack of central steering and ineffective legislation, municipalities by this time also began to concern themselves with the infrastructure and provision of services, besides offering financial support.93” (Bertens, 2021, p. 94)

In Utrecht, this is primarily visible after WWII [[From 1954, the Municipality of Utrecht tried to coordinate child health intervention in alignment with local and regional governments.]]

> “Such factors were sometimes directly responsible for the founding of a municipal health service, as in Rotterdam (accidents in the rapidly expanding harbor) or Groningen (an outbreak of scarlet fever).95” (Bertens, 2021, p. 94)

> “n this development, the capital led the charge in stepping in where central government or its instruments (the State Inspectorate, the municipal health councils) failed. Already in 1889, Amsterdam employed two doctors concerned with examining the health of municipal workers.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 94)

Hmm, in Utrecht, they were appointed by the municipal health services themselves.

> “This service was expanded rapidly, with a health service for newborns created in 1903, alongside a service employing school doctors in 1907, and an emergency service in 1908” (Bertens, 2021, p. 95)

Interesting, in Utrecht, it was the other way around: [[In Utrecht, school physicians prelude infant and toddler health intervention.]]

> “Other large cities quickly followed suit. The Hague and Utrecht founded services offering medical examinations, care for the poor, vaccinations and ambulances in 1914.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 95)

And earlier..

> “However, the growing interest of local governments in providing health care services was undeniable. Much like other collective provisions that were taken up by municipalities in this period – water supplies, transportation – the expansion of municipal health services could take place through a combination of growing social concerns and a notable absence of coordination by the state.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 95)

I don't see how coordination of the state could cause local initiative to rise. This is not convincing!

> “Whatever Thorbecke had envisioned when in 1851 he created his ‘Municipality’ was not entirely clear. But they often came to function as ‘laboratories for social legislation’, also in the area of health care.102” (Bertens, 2021, p. 96)

Vague.

#### “Hospital Care: Convergence Between Private and Public Financing” (Bertens, 2021, p. 96)

#### “Health Care Financing: Rhetoric vs Reality” (Bertens, 2021, p. 98)

> “This growth was theoretically not in opposition to the Liberal governmentality instituted in 1848 and extended in 1865 to health care – in the previous chapter, we have seen how local government was to play an important role in promoting (public) health after that latter year. However, what began to seriously undermine the rhetoric of local initiatives in the 1920s and 1930s was the increasing control that central government in the preceding decades had obtained over municipalities’ revenues and expenditures. A” (Bertens, 2021, p. 99)

I am not sure what 'control' means in these contexts..

> “A 1942 overview of the Cross Associations that operated across the country inventoried financial streams, and for the year 1940 the distribution was as shown in Table 2.4” (Bertens, 2021, p. 100)

> “n this inventory, municipal governments accounted for some 17% of the total income of the Cross Associations, with public revenue streams in general totaling nearly a third of the funding of these associations by 1940.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 100)

> “And as we have seen in table 2.1, especially Catholic ‘Crosses’ had been founded in large numbers since the early 1920s. Put mildly, this points to a discrepancy between the rhetorically dominant principle of subsidiarity (and ‘sphere sovereignty’ for Protestants) and the way in which public funding was increasingly keeping private initiative provisions financially afloat.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 100)

Well, this seems more the distinction between funding and excecution. [[In the middle of the twentieth century, a strong balance between municipal and civil initiatives formed the core of public health.]]

#### “Private Initiative, Publicly Backed” (Bertens, 2021, p. 101)

> “The state is not a universal nor in itself an autonomous source of power. The state is nothing else but the effect, the profile, the mobile shape of a perpetual statification [...] in the sense of incessant transactions which modify [...] sources of finance, modes of investment, decisionmaking centers, forms and types of control, relationships between local powers, the central authority, and so on [...].” (Bertens, 2021, p. 101)

This is a quote from Foucault on biopolitics. [[Foucault - 1978 - The birth of biopolitics]] -  makes me think what a [[state]] is in particular. Should look into this when reading the book #todo Especaiily when it becomes 'central'.

> “But as time progressed, the central state also became involved in facilitating access to health care through revisions of the scheme that regulated financial traffic between central and local governments.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 102)

> “Despite surface-level ‘rhetoric’, it was clear that by the 1930s, the Liberal governmentality of minimal state intervention in health care had been subtly transformed to a new governmentality, one we might name the governmentality of private initiative, publicly backed.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 102)

First, the range of health care provisions covered in the state-set package for people now mandatorily insured through the Decree increased drastically. Under Article 14 of the second Executive Decree (Uitvoeringsbesluit), care falling under any sickness fund policy would include the services of a GP, a midwife, and medical-specialist help; stay in a sanatorium for treating tuberculosis, as well as medicines and bandages.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 106)

> “The Netherlands hardly became a Social-Democratic powerhouse immediately after the war, and the inaction in social affairs instead represented well the sentiment of a significant part (if not the majority) of the Dutch population. Most illustrative of this development was the failure of the so-called ‘Breakthrough’ (Doorbraak) in the immediate post-war period. During the war years, political support had been growing for a radical break with the pre-war division of society along religious and ideological lines. Not only did the government-in-exile in London feature (in earnest for the first time) Social-Democrats such as Jan van den Tempel.17” (Bertens, 2021, p. 119)

> “In terms of organizations and morals anchored in ideology or religion, for much of the late 1940s and 1950s The Netherlands would revert to its pre-war ways of doing things – this was the high point of so-called ‘pillarization’ in The Netherlands, the division of political and social life along the lines of Protestantism, Catholicism, socialism, and those who did not wish to fall under one of those headings (among which the Liberals).181 And as James Kennedy, who studied the transition from the deeply religious and conservative Netherlands of the 1950s to its internationally exceptional progressive makeover in the 1960s, summarized the early 1960s:” (Bertens, 2021, p. 120)

This is indeed true for Utrecht, [[In the 1950s and 1960s, religion played implicitly an organisational role in organising preventive child health intervention. Explicitly this role was denied in a national level.]]

> “This rapid cultural ‘return to normalcy’ after the war was important, as it reflected pre-war ways of thinking about the state, the community and citizen responsibility. This also affected thinking about health care, as we shall see. A” (Bertens, 2021, p. 120)

But I do not find it convincing that the [[1941 Ziekenfondswet]] was not a breakthrough in terms of access to health care. It had deep influence on the governementality of Dutch population. Maybe this shifted back to its pre-war [[verzuiling]], but it is as much a different governmentality as it was in the 1970s.

#### “New Times, New Health Care Politics?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 123)

> “As far as The Netherlands were concerned, the Van Rhijn-report led to little immediate result, but the 1941 Sickness Funds Decree was immediately seen as an important step in furthering social arrangements.193 Two important elements in the state’s role in the way health insurance was now provided through the sickness funds must be discussed. The first concerns the staying in place of the Sickness Funds Decree. The second was the renewed interest in the (top-down) organization of health care, to which we will turn in later paragraphs.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 124)

> “n 2012, Robert Vonk discussed the question of the acceptance of the Sickness Funds Decree at length, concluding that the Decree was “[...] a compromise agreement which did right by both German as well as Dutch interests and desires”. Moreover, highly relevant was that “ [...] with just small adjustments, it would fit into the social politics of the Roman-Red coalition.”196” (Bertens, 2021, p. 125)

If periodization is the main contribution of this thesis, then I don't see why WW2 was not a breaking point (see above)

#### “Public Guarantees, Private Governance” (Bertens, 2021, p. 126)

> “Under the aegis and responsibility of a government which now guaranteed access to the broad mandatory insurance package, all parties involved could nevertheless uphold the idea that the locus of decision-making still lay for an important part with civil society and ‘private initiative’. Rhetoric and reality with regard to state-backed health care deliberated upon by a corporatist” (Bertens, 2021, p. 127)

> “Council in which both public and private interests were represented, were now wedded to each other in the Sickness Fund Council.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 128)

#### “War, Reconstruction, Reorganization” (Bertens, 2021, p. 128)

> “But with the Decree staying in place after the war, and within the post-war spirit of renewal and restoration, discussions on how to coordinate health care to best serve the public’s health again came to the fore.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 128)

> “In the previous chapter, we saw that earlier efforts by the government to foster cooperation between health services and to create more coherence had stranded on arguments of private initiative, financial constraints, or a combination of the two. But after the war, ideas about structuring health care regained urgency because the state had become a partner in the provision of health care for a significant part of the population.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 128)

Indeed, [[In 1950s and 1960s the municipalities forced collaboration and coordination zuigelingenzorg through subsidy policies]] and [[From 1954, the Municipality of Utrecht tried to coordinate child health intervention in alignment with local and regional governments.]]. Here, we see arising the idea of [[een rationele verdeling]].

> “Before the war many commentators had assessed positively the comparative quality of health care in The Netherlands. The effectiveness of the pre-war arrangements of municipal services, sickness fund insurance, and private initiatives such as the Cross Associations, had been high in keeping mortality and illness in The Netherlands low, internationally speaking.20” (Bertens, 2021, p. 129)

> “After giving a comprehensive overview of all existing provisions and legislation concerning health care, Sajet noted that the development of medicine and care was continuously showing a tendency toward expansion: in terms of disciplines, comprehensiveness and number of people seeking and being able to get help” (Bertens, 2021, p. 129)

Refers to that [[The Netherlands has a unique reputation and position with respect to the organisation and success of public health.]]

#### “Van Rhijn: A Rallying Cry for Private Initiative” (Bertens, 2021, p. 130)

> “So how to bring this philosophy in line with a positive role for the state in matters of health care? The answer was by now a familiar refrain: private initiative would have to retain primacy in the provision of health care, but there was room for representative councils fostering discussion and cooperation between these private institutions.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 131)

This matched the situation in the 1950s and 1960s in Utrecht: [[In 1950s and 1960s the municipalities forced collaboration and coordination zuigelingenzorg through subsidy policies]].

> “However, the report showed an interesting shift in the way the Catholics now openly began to endorse governmental subsidies for these nominally ‘private’ institutions, in effect embracing the shift from the rhetoric that emphasized the identity of these care providers as private institutions, to the reality of how they were increasingly funded – that is, by the government.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 131) I don't see this as contrasting

> “Despite holding firmly on to a philosophy as old as Catholic political participation in The Netherlands, the benefits brought about by a government that concerned itself with the health and welfare of its citizens were by now clearly recognized. But in maintaining that private initiative should be left free to organize its own operations, while simultaneously relying on public subsidies, the Catholics argued for the benefits of public involvement without its negative consequences – financial support, but without control.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 132)

This matched the situation in the 1950s and 1960s in Utrecht: [[In 1950s and 1960s the municipalities forced collaboration and coordination zuigelingenzorg through subsidy policies]].

#### “A Political Matter Best Left to Parties in the Field” (Bertens, 2021, p. 132)

> “It is true that the rapid appearance of several reports on health care organization pointed to the dominant position of private initiative in the field of health care provision since the 1920s – of which the Cross Associations, which had so rapidly expanded since that decade, were the best example. But under the influence of new Social-Democratic ideals, as well as the greater role for the state after the introduction of the Sickness Funds Decree, the institution of the Central Committee for Public Health (Centrale Commissie voor de Volksgezondheid) signified a subtle shift towards more government interest and influence in health care – apart from the ‘hard’ intervention of the Sickness Funds Decree, and despite the rapid failure of Van Rhijn’s far-reaching plans.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 133)


#### “Case Study: The Elusive Matter of Hospital Planning” (Bertens, 2021, p. 135)

#### “The Health Act of 1956” (Bertens, 2021, p. 139)

> “This fact was stressed further by the way in which the [[1956 Gezondheidswet]] tasked the nation’s provinces with creating provincial health councils, perhaps euphemistically named ‘peripheral organs’ in the memorandum to the act. Again, these councils would not have executive powers, but rather the task to coordinate between various parties: “The Provincial Council has, in the first and maybe most important place, the task to stimulate and promote health care provided by others”.246 It” (Bertens, 2021, p. 141)

Based on the health act [[1952 Subsidieregeling voor Kruisverenigingen]]. Form this moment onward, in Utrecht, the province was increasingly involved in organizing public health action. Bertens is correct that the [[Provinciale Raad voor de Volksgezondheid in de provincie Utrecht]] only had a coordinating role, albeit that [[C.J.W. Frijlink]] as provincial supporter was quite powerfull.

> “What the [[1956 Gezondheidswet]] codified was a capitulation to private initiative. “With the implementation of this act, our country will have accepted a new, even unique principle in the sanitary-organizational field. A very important part of Public Health will be exempt from governmental control and transferred to private associations and municipal boards”, a critical doctor opined.2” (Bertens, 2021, p. 141) Critcial docter was JJ van Loghem in TVvG

> “As a result, where deliberations on the organization of health care was concerned, private initiative was officially recognized as an equal partner to government.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 142)

This is recognisable: [[In the first half of the 20th century, civil society played a pivotal role in Dutch public health.]] resulting in [[The organisational model of civil and public preventive medicine was co-produced.]].

#### “Private Initiative Unfettered” (Bertens, 2021, p. 143)

> “More recently, historian Kees-Jan van Klaveren has given a more positive assessment in arguing that, for all its shortcomings, the Health Act for the first time managed to get the government involved in the organization of Dutch health care.25” (Bertens, 2021, p. 143)

> “Let us take a look at what ‘private initiative’ meant on the ground. How did the health services offered by the municipalities and the Cross Associations, defended so fiercely against government incursions, fare in this period?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 144)

> “The most immediate consequence was the way in which municipalities were relieved from what before the war had become an increasing financial strain: the subsidizing of hospital patients via the back door provided by the Poor Law” (Bertens, 2021, p. 144)

Is this true? How did budgetting work before WW2

> “While the municipalities accounted for various health services in the cities, the private Cross Associations continued their pre-war activities of offering health care in (mostly) rural areas. As we have seen, the initial focus had lain on the combating of infectious diseases, in the absence of municipal action on that front. But by the middle of the 1950s, the tasks of the ‘Crosses’ were expanded to include home nursing, child care (pre- and postnatal, and all the way through primary school), the fighting of tuberculosis, venereal disease, cancer, and providing” (Bertens, 2021, p. 145)

Another argument for [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]]

> “Whichever needs there were in the domain of public health, the Cross Associations have provided.”265” (Bertens, 2021, p. 146)

> “This flexibility contributed to their great success, a development which continued after the war: subscription to the Associations doubled from 30% to 60% of the population between 1940 and 1957.266 By 1957, there were 1579 local associations, up from 1335 in 1941.267 If the important role the Crosses played in the totality of health care was clear to proponents of private initiative, the increased stake placed in them by government was at the same time hard to miss.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 146)

> “But despite the fact that subsidies for the Cross Associations in the 1950s and ‘60s retained a (mostly) unregulated character, the importance of public financing already begun in the pre-war era only grew.268” (Bertens, 2021, p. 146)

> “By the late 1960s, secularization and deconfessionalization set in, a development which would take its toll on the autonomy of Cross Associations organized along religious lines and underpinned by confessional ideologies of state non-intervention.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 146)

This is something to relate to: [[ontzuiling]] is indeed important in desoling the autonomy of the Cross Societies. But this nevertheless is an argument for. [[In the first half of the 20th century, civil society played a pivotal role in Dutch public health.]]

> “On the political front, moreover, convergence between the historically charity and solidarity-based Crosses and the expansion of the welfare state gradually put ‘private initiative’ under pressure, as provisions were increasingly incorporated in the [[1965 Ziekenfondswet]] package or the [[1968 Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]] ” (Bertens, 2021, p. 146)

> “In 1961, a scheme for subsidies to national and provincial Cross Associations that aimed at partially subsidizing personnel costs was implemented by Minister Veldkamp. Juffermans, Staat en gezondheidszorg, 244.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 146)

This is significant: health needs provided by Cross Societies were taken over by mandatory insurance. What consequense does this have for the parties involved? #todo

### “Part III: Blueprint Governmentality, 1968-1987 In which the social ideology of access to health care is taken up by the state, but a new governmentality of state ‘planning’ in health care fails” (Bertens, 2021, p. 161)

Instead, the government should create the conditions under which the health of individuals would best be served. But these ‘conditions’ were interpreted fairly broadly in the following paragraph: they should include the governmental ordering of health care; sickness fund insurance; subsidizing private initiative; the building of hospitals; social-medical research and the furthering of preventive medicine.27” (Bertens, 2021, p. 172)

> “the governance structures put in place by the Nazi oppressor were retained. But the governmentality shifted in an important way: Dutch politicians who before the war would have openly resisted the idea that the state had a real role to play in health care now saw and supported the benefits of centrally-regulated access and equality. The [[1965 Ziekenfondswet]] was passed in Parliament without any struggle, taking effect in October 1964, and setting the stage for the more ambitious health care reforms that were in the making.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 173)

Should look into this #todo

> “From the perspective of governmentality, even more interesting was a remark which would foreshadow the failure of attempts at top-down ‘planning’ of health care in the next decade. Overseeing the historical growth of Dutch health care led Veldkamp and Bartels to observe the following: Great pluriformity, both in the relations between governmental and non-governmental parties and in social life, is not just very typical of the structure of Dutch health care, but it constitutes an element which is essential to health care policy. A policy which does not do justice to the essential characteristics of this structure will be doomed to failure, given Dutch relations.40” (Bertens, 2021, p. 175)

> “This meant that, from now on, the state guaranteed access to a broad package of care arrangements for chronic or lifelong ailments, through a national insurance that was financed by wage premiums (initially set at a nominal 0.4% of income), employer premiums, as well as a direct state subsidy and (small) personal contributions.51” (Bertens, 2021, p. 177)

#### “The Beginning of a New Governmentality” (Bertens, 2021, p. 178)

> “With the [[1968 Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]], and the legislative work of Veldkamp more generally, the gradual growth of a legal discourse on the right to health care and the actual governmental practice of expanding access to it since the 1912 Poor Law came together both ideologically and practically.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 178)

Not convinced of this "actual governmental practice"

> “The reality of the government taking a social interest – with both central and local government increasingly subsidizing or organizing health care arrangements – was, at long last, complemented by a new discourse or rhetoric of health care as a human right and a responsibility of the collective – now interpreted more and more as the government, and less in terms of (religious) social collectives.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 178)

> “Firstly, the [[1968 Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]] changed the financing of the system of long-term care in important ways. Before the act, governmental subsidies towards financing such types of care were delivered through (initially) the [[1912 gewijzigde Armenwet]], and then the General Act on Financial Assistance of 1965. The administration of both acts had been a matter for municipal governments. Only with the latter law had the central government become directly implicated, as it now had to retrospectively reimburse municipalities” (Bertens, 2021, p. 179)

> “But with the AWBZ, the municipal middleman was cut out. The various types of funds financing the AWBZ went directly to a newly created General Fund for Exceptional Medical Expenses, which fell under the Minister of Social Affairs. And ostensibly, in the scheme of the AWBZ the health care ‘field’ still had a serious role to play, as the General Fund was managed by the Sickness Fund Council.58” (Bertens, 2021, p. 179)

> “Secondly, the AWBZ gave off an unequivocal signal: from now on, access to certain expensive types of health care would be guaranteed by the government” (Bertens, 2021, p. 179)

> “The third and final element concerned perhaps the most visible exercise of governmental power under the new act. Much like the Sickness Funds Decree had first given the government power over the sickness funds through its setting, by decree, of admission requirements (in order for sickness funds to act as carriers for the new insurance), the AWBZ introduced requirements for providers of health care on the one hand and for insurers on the other.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 180)

#### “Small Steps Towards Organizing Health Care” (Bertens, 2021, p. 181)

> “But the milestones in Dutch health care policy of the 1960s also made inevitable a new ‘governmentality’: in keeping a broadly accessible health care affordable, after more than a century of (nominally) hands-off policy the central government had to step in.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 181)

> “Moreover, the creation of social provisions in the previous decades now tied in with the broader movements towards democratization, political renewal and social justice felt worldwide in the 1960s. Connecting these developments could be seen as the essential project of the 1973-1977 cabinet: what was called for was to make use of the ‘malleability of society’ [‘maakbaarheid van de samenleving’; RB].” (Bertens, 2021, p. 184)

> “Between 1977 and 1981, the national budget deficit grew from 3,8% to 8,2%.87 Despite the ambitious goals of the progressive cabinet, the economic downturn therefore quickly made clear that the post-war belief in near-unlimited growth had been unwarranted.88 Moreover, it called for immediate political action, since it prompted the question how the social achievements of the new welfare state could be retained while its cost could be kept in check?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 186)

> “Concerning the Dutch context, the [[1974 Structuurnota]] conclusions were unequivocal: the ‘patchwork’ of health care provisions and financing schemes that had been criticized after the war was still very much in place. Across the board, there was a lack of mechanisms for keeping expenditures in check, an incoherent and uneven spread of provisions, a lack of cooperation between institutions and too little policy where the training of new medical professionals was concerned.92” (Bertens, 2021, p. 186)

> “The message was clear: post-war financial growth had blinded policy-makers to the near-absolute lack of coordination within the system, allowing it to grow organically.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 186)

So financial pressure was a motivation to think about [[een rationele verdeling]], causing, on a local level, [[In 1950s and 1960s the municipalities forced collaboration and coordination zuigelingenzorg through subsidy policies]]

> “The second element of Hendriks’ plan, ‘regionalization’, in a sense echoed earlier ideas about implementing district health services, which would serve as regional bases from which health care provisions could be coordinated. The idea that decentralized organization offered the best option for streamlining the Dutch health care field was also very much a central point in Hendriks’ view.

> “Echoing Margaret Thatcher, Ruud Lubbers and his administration quickly came to speak of the Netherlands in terms of a company, in need of ‘managing’ through ‘no-nonsense policy’.130 Underlying the desire to give free rein to business in order to stimulate job growth was the assumption that an increased role for business and civil society would have to come at the cost of the size and influence of the government.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 196)

> “In just a few years, the 1973-1977 focus on ‘planning’ and ‘remaking society’ would once again be replaced by a strong emphasis on private initiative and the maxim of small government.

Ah - the book really is about showing that a neo-liberal wind is in fact an continuous development. The following might be the most central sentence to his thesis:

> “In this light, the new governmentality of the ‘regulated health care market’ proposed in the late 1980s was a radical break with the most recent governmentality of planning, but not with older notions of independence, autonomy and the primacy of citizens in social affairs, now tied to the need to contain costs” (Bertens, 2021, p. 199)

> “That there was a strong line of continuity in this tradition even under the 1980s confessional-liberal cabinets can be seen by looking at two lines of policy aimed at keeping health care financially sustainable: the continuation of the structuring plans set out by Hendriks in 1974, and the introduction of a ‘minor system reform’, which would have major consequences for the social character of the health care system.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 199) Important

> “Most significant from the perspective of governmentality shifts with regard to private and public provision of health care was the way in which in 1980 the extramural care provided through the Cross Associations came to be financed through the [[1980 Gewijzigde Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]].” (Bertens, 2021, p. 200)

Ah! So the AWBZ meant the end of the power of cross societies?
		Well, not exactly, the case of Utrecht in extramural care (see: [[Maatschappelijke gezondheidszorg Reorganisatie en fusie in de gezinsverzorging - reorganisatie, fusie, 1985-1987]]) is a good example.

> “These associations, which twenty years before had still been the exemplars of ‘private initiative’ in health care – though they had become increasingly dependent on government subsidies, as we have seen – under increasing financial pressure saw the benefit of officially being brought into the governmentally mandated insurance scheme. Veder-Smit managed to have a motion to that effect passed in 1979, and on January 1, 1980, the ‘Crosses’ came within the fold of Veldkamp’s broad national insurance. In terms of governmentality, this was a significant shift, as what had been the pinnacle of ‘private initiative’ in (public) health care arrangements for decades now became part of the national scheme of distributing funds for long-term care.144” (Bertens, 2021, p. 200)

> “in March 1986 Van der Reijden managed to get the 1986 Wet Toegang Ziektekostenverzekering accepted by Parliament. Through this act, voluntary sickness fund insurance (including the separate insurance scheme for the elderly) was dissolved. The insureds it concerned were instead divided amongst sickness funds (1,7 million) and private insurers (800.000), on the basis of their income. In line with Van der Reijden’s social motives, private insurers were now obliged to offer a standardized health insurance package with maximized premiums to those over 65, which effectively closed the option of risk selection or an endless raising of premiums for those formerly insured through a sickness fund. To further strengthen solidarity, two satellite acts were passed which forced those who were privately insured to contribute financially to the sickness funds’ portfolio (Act MOOZ), and to even out the differences between private insurers with a healthy portfolio and those with an unhealthy one (Act ILPZ).158 T” (Bertens, 2021, p. 204)

### “Part IV: Governmentality of the Regulated Market, 1987-2015 In which the introduction of the ‘health care market’ goes back to an old governmentality, but the state’s role in providing access to health care grows larger than ever” (Bertens, 2021, p. 209)

Concept note: [[Between 1987-2015, the introduction of the ‘health care market’ goes back to an old governmentality, but the state’s role in providing access to health care grows larger than ever]]

#### “Introduction” (Bertens, 2021, p. 210)

> “The proposal put forward in the important ‘Dekker-report’ by [[Wisse Dekker]] of 1987 was one of instituting a ‘regulated health care market’: instead of the ‘paternalistic’, big government of the preceding decades, the parties in the field would once again have to take the reins in keeping costs in health care at an acceptable level. T” (Bertens, 2021, p. 210)

> “The old governmentality of ‘private initiative’ therefore was fused together with the extensive responsibilities that the central state had taken on in the post-war decades to provide the Dutch citizenry with access to health care. This development had unmistakable paradoxical qualities: a blueprint had to be provided by the state in order to bring about a health care ‘market’.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 211)

#### “A New Governmentality for Health Care” (Bertens, 2021, p. 215)

> “Where [[Jo Hendriks]]’ governmentality had been labeled one of ‘planning’, Dekker’s soon came to stand for introducing the ‘market’ into health care. But much like Hendriks’ idea of ‘planning’ still focused on decentralization and more, but definitively not absolute, governmental power, Dekker’s notions of what a health care ‘market’ should look like had deeply paradoxical qualities” (Bertens, 2021, p. 216)

> “In this way, the most radical break presented in the 1987 report for reorganizing health care was the conscious construction of a market environment for health insurance and health care provision, to a large degree safeguarded and regulated by the government. In the most clear-cut expression yet of such thinking, the governmentality of gaining control over an increasingly expensive health care system was formulated as follows: The opinion has taken hold that a regulating, planning and paternalistic government should retreat in order to make place for a form of governance [‘beheersmodel’, RB] in which the state creates boundary conditions and the health care sector itself puts things in order.16” (Bertens, 2021, p. 217)

#### “Rethinking the System, One Report at a Time” (Bertens, 2021, p. 218)

> “However, from a longue durée perspective, the most important reason for the overall failure of reforming the health care system in such a way as to meet Dekker’s ideas of a regulated health care market was the fact that a top-down, blueprint approach did not agree with how Dutch health care had grown organically in the past.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 219) Yes - I think that it is convincing to state that top-down reform does not match the Dutch political culture

> “And in 2006, both the parties in the field and the government would together create a system marked by extensive solidarity and apparent respect for ‘private initiative’, now in the form of private market parties.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 219) 

Interesting - would be curious to see how this shift from civil to market initiative looks like! [[From the 1980s, private initiative undergo a transition from being organised by civil society to being organised by commercial parties.]]

> “Shortly after coming into power, the Minister of 'small steps’ decided to reverse important measures Simons had taken in transferring various types of care to the AWBZ in an effort to turn this insurance scheme into the ‘carrier’ of basic insurance.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 228)

This is about Els Borst

> “in 1995 Borst-Eilers officially divided health care into three compartments. The first compartment contained classic AWBZ-care; the second those types of cure traditionally covered by the Sickness Fund Act; and the remainder was to be covered by private insurance” (Bertens, 2021, p. 228)

I am wondering to which extent this new devision had consequenses for child health intervention. #todo

> “Despite the fact that ‘Dekker’ had gone underground, the new Minister did little to prevent the parties in the field from organizing themselves in a more competition-oriented fashion after the measures instituted by Hans Simons in 1992.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 229)

#### “A ‘Silent Revolution’” (Bertens, 2021, p. 229)

> “Although Borst-Eilers rolled back changes with regard to the AWBZ-package, she did not reverse the measures taken by Simons to facilitate convergence between public sickness funds and private insurers – a precondition in Dekker’s proposals for a system based on competition.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 230)

> “In the absence of active governmental policy to implement the twin goals of Dekker (mandatory insurance and the market), in the 1990s sickness funds and private insurers rapidly dwindled in number but grew in size, through mergers and acquisitions. In effect, this would leave less room for real competition by the time that the Dekker-plans were implemented in 2006.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 231)

In other words: it is a complex and contradictory synthesis of neoliberal, corporatist and Social-Democratic elements.”115” (Bertens, 2021, p. 241)

> “Even though these authors discuss political policy – and not the conduct of the ‘field parties’ in, for instance, health care – it is striking to what extent politics and field parties in Dutch health care by this time displayed such a strange mix of ideological standpoints, calling” (Bertens, 2021, p. 241)

Curious what these "field parties" are?

> “for autonomy for the parties in the field while also broadly agreeing that rolling back governmental backing of the right to health care was not desirable. Let us see why this was the case.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 242)

> “In a new organizing principle for governance, patients, insurers and providers would become dependent on each other (with the patient as central actor), forcing the system as a whole to become less costly through effective market mechanisms, competition and a consumer-driven orientation. As far as government interference in a system which was to become self-regulating was concerned, the maxim was to be a simple “no, unless...”. Unless either the solidarity principle or the quality of care came to suffer through an ineffective functioning of the new scheme, the confusing supply-side regulation of the past decade had to make way for the primacy of insurers and care providers in their endeavor to optimize their care ‘output’ and negotiations on prices.116” (Bertens, 2021, p. 243)

#### From Care Assured to Supplying Demand” (Bertens, 2021, p. 243)

> “Supplying Demand identified two main problems that had to be resolved through (once again) large-scale system reform. Firstly, centralized budgeting and supply-side regulation had led to insufficient opportunity and ‘incentives’ for the parties in the field to act in an effective and qualitatively excellent manner. Secondly, the mix of existing insurance schemes had led to a fragmentation in the provision of care, which had also resulted in limited power on the side of insurers to negotiate and of patients to exert consumer power.126” (Bertens, 2021, p. 244)

#### “Catalyzing the Need for Reform” (Bertens, 2021, p. 245)

#### “The Final Stretch” (Bertens, 2021, p. 248)

> “On June 14, 2005, the [[2006 Zorgverzekeringswet]] passed through the Senate. In late 2005, the Implementation Act that laid down the rules for governing the details of the system reform was passed in Parliament, followed by the act on the supervision of the system through the Dutch Health Care Authority in the middle of 2006.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 250)

#### “A Radical New Paradigm?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 250)

> “was clear that there could be no talk of a strong separation of state from market, solidarity from individuality, private from public in the by now vast mandatory provision of health care to an unprecedented part of the population.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 251)

> “This is because of the complex entanglement of social goals with the new, privately administered, system.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 251)

This, however, is an interesting conclusion: governmental social goals were taken over by an organisation and operationalisation depended on decentral organisations. Makes me wonder whether indeed commercial parties took over from civil initiatives. #todo >> [[From the 1980s, private initiative undergo a transition from being organised by civil society to being organised by commercial parties.]]

> “For alongside the introduction of the regulated health care market in 2006, a long sought-after policy goal was finally achieved: a broad national insurance for every Dutch citizen, with no differentiation between insurance holders on the basis of their income. The road to this universal insurance had not been without obstacles or paradoxes, as we have seen. Where the Social-Democrat Simons failed in introducing it, it would be the Liberal Hoogervorst who by 2005 managed to steer a broad, basic insurance with an unprecedented degree of income-levelling solidarity through Parliament. This happened after an intervening decade in which grand system reform was deemed anathema for having become synonymous with governmental overreach. Nevertheless, by 2006, a true revolution had taken place in the way access to care was now guaranteed through the link between government and private insure” (Bertens, 2021, p. 251)

Indeed interesting that the [[2006 Zorgverzekeringswet]] combines this social goals with commercial organisation, and I am convinced that the continuity of the role of the central government is not far-fetched.

#### “Constructing the Health Care Markets” (Bertens, 2021, p. 253)

> “To facilitate all this, while keeping a close watch on the general workings of the system, the government had ostensibly taken a backseat in order to let market operations develop without a framework of ‘planning’ and state interventions.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 254)

> “Much in line with the political-ideological thinking which had (for the most part) dominated debates about the state’s relation to the health care field since Thorbecke, autonomy would have to be given back to ‘field parties’ through the creation of a regulated market in health care. In 2006, these proposals were put into law. With the Health Insurance Act, the mandatory insurance scheme executed by private insurers came into force. And the Act on Market Regulation in Health Care gave the government (through its Healthcare Authority) the power to construct or develop the three distinct health care ‘markets’ which should serve to curb costs while increasing quality and the market power of health care ‘consumers’.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 271)

This focus on "field parties" is significant in understanding [[From the 1980s, private initiative undergo a transition from being organised by civil society to being organised by commercial parties.]]

> “Instead, the new governmentality seems marked by the historically recurring mismatch between the rhetoric concerning the dominant governmentality in Dutch health care, and the actual reality of the state having an important say in how the field is organized and financed.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 272)

This is too week - 'reality' is much focused on the top of the political pyramid

> “Firstly, as far as ‘constructing’ markets is concerned, the state has kept its competition authorities on a tight leash, which has led to ever-growing concentrations of power in the insurance and hospital markets. The argument is that as long as accessibility and affordability of health care are not threatened, actively creating competition between smaller parties is not a priority.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 272)

> “Secondly, where the performance of health insurers as the new ‘directors’ of the system is concerned – having theoretically taken over this role from the state in 2006 – it seems that this ‘directing’ role is one not gladly taken up by the insurers. Although just four of them account for a vast majority of the health insurance market, these power positions have neither led to harsh insurance practices with regard to clients, nor to tough negotiation on prices with health care providers. All of this has to do with the social underpinnings of the health insurance system, but also with the important role the state still plays in setting the budget for health care and the general ‘rules of the market game’.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 272)

> “All in all, it seems that since its inception, the focus has shifted ever more towards the ‘regulated’ part of the ‘regulated market’ in health care. Stimulating the public goals of accessibility, affordability and quality that underlie the health care system has, up till now, only been pursued through a very light market-oriented policy – and not at all through the creation of real competition in health care, or the serious delegation of crucial tasks such as budgetsetting.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 272)

Yes, it is important to emphasise that the Dutch health care market is not a 'real market'. I am not convinced, though, that the lacking "harsh insurer practices" or "though negotiations" are the result of "the public goals of accessibility, affordability, and quality that underlie the health care system." This causal relationship seems problematic to me.

> “Oddly, a reversal of roles has seemingly taken place in an area of health care traditionally shielded from private or market operations: long-term care. Moreover, part of that care has been decentralized, much in line with an old governmentality in which municipal governments had an important role to play in facilitating access to health care. We turn now to these transitions.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 272)

I do think, however, that the role of the municipality is indeed interesting.


#### “Long-Term Care: Back to Thorbecke?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 273)

> “Thorbecke, as we saw in chapter 1, saw in local (and mostly private) initiatives the best perspective and opportunities for ‘organic growth’ of the ‘vital power’ of the Dutch nation. Citizens should be empowered in order to realize their true potential, and the state had only a (limited) role in removing obstacles from the road to such self-realization.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 273)

> “For health care, this was partly realized through [[1854 Armenwet]] and the [[1865 Wet regelende het Geneeskundig Staatstoezicht]] legislation that created the State Inspectorate.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 273)

> “As we have seen in part 2, it would take until [[1912 gewijzigde Armenwet]] created far more leeway for municipal governments to support the poor and facilitate selfrealization by subsidizing and creating (ever greater) access to health care.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 273)

> “To this decentralized responsibility for health care came and end, first, in 1941, when many of the tasks taken up by municipalities in subsidizing hospital care were subsumed under the [[1941 Ziekenfondswet]]” (Bertens, 2021, p. 273)

> “And in [[1965 Ziekenfondswet]] and [[1968 Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]], central government centralized the provision of health care even further with the General Act on Financial Assistance and the AWBZ.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 273)

> “Though it would be highly anachronistic to say that reforms in health care since [[2006 Zorgverzekeringswet]] have aimed to bring the role of the state in health care back to Thorbeckian proportions, important institutional and cultural changes to the [[1968 Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]] and the provision of care on the municipal level nevertheless recall the spirit of the old Poor Law and its attendant focus on self-care, local solidarity and private initiative.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 273)

#### “A New Role for Municipalities?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 274)

> “The move towards a ‘new culture’ of strengthening the autonomy of patients and bringing care closer to citizens ran parallel to the institution of the regulated market in curative care.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 274)

Yes - preventive care and public health quitley disappeared in the thesis

> “Somewhat in the shadow of the Health Insurance Act, the Balkenende-cabinet in 2003 came up with a legislative proposal which would strengthen the responsibilities of municipalities to provide care, mostly in the form of social support. This proposal suggested an important overhaul concerning long-term care: to improve clarity as to what care citizens were entitled to, while it potentially also created budgetary space, services for those dependent on long-term care such as domestic help, housing and transport would be made a responsibility for municipalities. This also meant redrafting some legislation, such as the Act on Provisions for the Handicapped. This meant in practice that some 1,3 billion euros of AWBZ funds would now become the responsibility of municipalities. The Act on Societal Support (Wet maatschappelijke ondersteuning) passed in late 2006, and came into force on 1 January 2007.226” (Bertens, 2021, p. 274)

> “Such participation would be facilitated by municipalities providing house cleaning, medical aids such as wheelchairs, and home adaptations in order to keep people from having to move into a care home. The decentralization of such care was presented as an improvement on the one-size-fitsall approach under the old AWBZ. However, decentralization also meant relying on the subjective judgment of municipal civil servants as to what care was needed for different patients, and codifying this subjectivity in national legislation.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 274)

> “The 2007 Act on Social Support therefore reintroduced local government as an important player in supporting citizens in matters of care and social support. Moreover, it would be further expanded in the 2015 Act on Social Support.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 275)

So it is decentralisation of curative care? What about public health? This is organised under the [[2008 wet publieke gezondheid]] which was a integration of, among others the [[2001 gewijzigde wet collectieve preventie]], which was prequeled by the [[1989 wet collectieve preventie Volksgezondheid]]. This story is missing from Roland's thesis. This is a pity because the tension between local and national governments is visible in those laws.

> “Moreover, bringing local government ‘back to the people’ again – with a mandate to strengthen social networks – would hopefully lead to “ [...] new mixed forms of solidarity, in which government and society complement and strengthen each other.” Lastly, financial considerations played a role.23” (Bertens, 2021, p. 275)

This is about the Wet Langdurige Zorg (WLZ)

> “Under the new Act, municipalities have the obligation to enter into conversation with patients seeking assistance, and to provide a ‘tailored solution’ to meet their needs. Providing a personalized care budget is also still an option.233 In 2015 decentralizing and ‘self-care’ therefore became firmly entrenched in the overall provision of health care, a development mirrored in the Act on Long-Term Care, to which we now turn.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 275) WLZ

#### “Reforming Long Term Care” (Bertens, 2021, p. 276)

> “More interesting from a cultural perspective was the second reason for revising longterm care. “We are lucky to grow older, partly as a result of health care. At the same time, this results in new demands on our quality of life. People want to live at home for as long as possible and without being lonely. Often, support from their own social network or (municipal) home care provider will be needed.”236 The State Secretary here seemed to note a mentality shift although arguably one also desired by the government in order to bring down expenditures.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 276) From AWBZ to WLZ

> “The dominant medical focus of the [[1980 Gewijzigde Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]] no longer offered enough flexibility for chronically ill or old patients who nevertheless wished for more autonomy in giving shape to their lives and health care” (Bertens, 2021, p. 277)

> “In order to achieve all of this, turning the AWBZ into the Act on Long-Term Care meant ‘slimming down’ to a core-AWBZ – which would still cover stays in institutions, personal care and nursing tailored to the disability or impairment in question, and medical aids. Significantly, in order to facilitate ‘autonomy’, the personalized care budget that allowed patients to contract their own long-term care provider was kept in place in the new act. Certain care provisions would be transferred to the [[2006 Zorgverzekeringswet]](broadly: curative care and district nursing).240 Finally, care provisions crucial to enabling citizens to ‘participate’ once again would be delegated to municipalities.241 In late September 2014, the Act on Long-Term Care passed in Parliament, and in January 2015 replaced the AWBZ.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 277) Misses the Jeugdwet

> “Under the new system, some 80% of costs covered under the AWBZ still fell under the Act on Long-Term Care and the Health Insurance Act; the remainder was delegated to the municipalities on the basis of the Social Support Act.244 This leads us to the question of what the reform of long-term care has meant for the ‘governmentality’ of that part of the health care system?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 278)

#### “Long Term Reform in Culture?” (Bertens, 2021, p. 278)

> “In short, where a hundred years ago people would have been happy to receive a modicum of care from a municipality which chose to give its own interpretation to the vague wordings of the Poor Law, judges now by and large limit the arbitrariness and subjective nature of, for instance, the Rotterdam municipality choosing to reimburse fewer hours of house cleaning than the municipality of Leeuwarden.250 Where the government’s focus on stimulating ‘participation’ and self-care is concerned, the jury is still out. For civil servants, in 2018 the glass was both half-full and half-empty where the implementation of the reform of long-term care was concerned.251” (Bertens, 2021, p. 280)

Interesting observation

#### “Conclusion” (Bertens, 2021, p. 280)

> “The new governmentality envisioned in 2001 and implemented in 2006 was intended to reduce the role of the central government and to delegate tasks formerly performed by the state, while it also aimed at achieving the older goal of cost reduction – which had been the primary motivation behind the governmentality of ‘planning’ dominant between 1974 and 1987.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 281)

> “To introduce this new governmentality, three new ‘markets’ in health care had to be introduced: one of insurers and patients, one of insurers and care providers, and one of patients and care providers. Within and between these separate markets, market characteristics such as negotiation over prices, active consumer choice and the lowering of insurance premiums and the raising of the quality of care to attract patients were deemed essential features to protect and improve three social goals underlying the system: good affordability, accessibility and quality of care.” (Bertens, 2021, p. 281)
