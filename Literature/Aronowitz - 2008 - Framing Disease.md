> “argue for a third broad etiological framework: the role played by the ways we generally recognize, define, name, and categorize disease states and attribute them to a cause or set of causes. These framing effects shape population health by influencing: health and illness beliefs; patterns of consumption and other behaviors; perceptions of what interventions and policies work; class, ethnic, and other social dynamics; and clinical and public health practices.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 1)

> “Important characteristics of many framing phenomena are their capacity to be self-perpetuating and their performative power. A better understanding of framing effects can lead to deploying them more deliberatively and flexibly to improve individual and population health.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 1)

Interesting - the use of framing and employing performative power to *improve* health.

> “One contentious issue in establishing this emerging paradigm is the mechanism by which social factors lead to health and disease in the bodies of individuals. Frequently, the shorthand for this issue is ‘‘how does culture get under the skin?’’” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 1)

> “These are ways that the health of individuals and populations results from how societies generally recognize, define, name, and categorize disease states and attribute them to a cause or set of causes.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 2)

This sounds like a very pragmatic take on the potential of disease categories.

>“Many of these causal pathways are frequently uncovered in standard epidemiological studies but are categorized as biases or confounders rather than as causes or mediating influences.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 2) 

Interesing, becuase it makes the shift from confounders/biases to causes - I must admit that I do not fully get the difference.

>“But I will argue below that these framing phenomena are sometimes the very mechanisms by which the social patterning of health and illness emerges.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 2)

Now we've got epiphenomena, confouders, biases, causes, and mechanismes. Some concpetual clarity would not be a luxureous good.

>“Below I survey a range of framing mechanisms and consider the plausibility of understanding them as etiological in the social patterning of health.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 2)

> “It is much less widely recognized, especially in the emerging field of population health and the policy attention given to health disparities, that framing phenomena (1) in aggregate represent a mechanism causing or mediating some of the social and temporal patterns of health and disease in the contemporary U.S. and (2) that much of the evidence for ‘‘framing as mechanism’’ is right before our eyes in the medical and epidemiological literature and yet is not recognized as such, in large measure because from the perspective of everyday medical and public health rationality, these phenomena are obstacles and diversions from understanding ‘‘true’’ causal mechanisms.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 2)  
- Reading this, I think that I prefer "conceptualising" over "framing" - indeed, for its connotation with what Aronowitz calls "constructionist arguments".  
- I also don't really get what the "social and temporal patterns of disease" are.

> “The expanding literature on the social determinants of health does not need another ‘‘arrow salad’’ in which everything causes everything else.1” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 3)

I like this sentence, and especially the idea of an "arrow salad" - quite a vivid picture.

>“have been rising” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 3)

Obvious comment: can be the result of measuring practices.

> “Yet, there are clues in the existing clinical and epidemiological literature that the distribution of asthma diagnoses also reflects historically conditioned values, interests, and social structures, many of which might be profitably studied and understood with the methods of a cultural anthropologist or medical historian.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 3)

>  “In this case, ‘‘culture may have gotten under the skin’’ by the way interacting socio-economic realities (lack of insurance, inadequate primary care) and beliefs about disease (e.g. that people with poor follow-up do better with the asthma diagnosis and immediate treatment rather than watchful waiting) create social patterns of health and disease that can at some point also become self-sustaining.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 3)

> “The self-sustaining aspect occurs when the perceived social patterning of disease itself becomes a part of the diagnostic act, in this case the fact that asthma is perceived to be more prevalent among the poor itself favors the diagnosis of asthma among the poor.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 3) 

I am indeed fascinated by cases like these - the "selfsustaining" argument is important.

> “As a result of a complicated if characteristic social history for gendered diagnoses” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 3)

Ok - but this is slightly vague. What did then cause the connection with gender and headache diagnosis. (Nevertheless, I do get the point).

> “The Will Rogers phenomenon (and related framing effects discussed below such as apparent, improved case fatality rates that have resulted from screening, changed thresholds for pathological diagnosis, and new pre-cancer diagnoses) has undoubtedly contributed to the impression that there has been widespread medical progress in cancer survival.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 4)

> “This belief has then been used to justify further investments in cancer diagnostic and therapeutic technology and practices, leading to further apparent progress and so on.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 4)

Great so techbology releted framing directs technological developments, which, in turn, influence framing and even health progress

> “Another key insight is the way that some beliefs and perceptions about causality and efficacy have performative power. They can be actors in, not simply reflections of, the health of individuals and populations.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 4)

> “While Feinstein et al. understood the Will Rogers phenomenon as a bias and illusion to be factored out of better and more accurate epidemiological observations, it nevertheless may have had a ‘‘real’’ effect on individual and collective ideas about what works and where future investments should be made.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 4)

It is however not entirely true that stating that the framing mechanism is a "bias", means that it cannot have a real effect.

> “In some other interactions, a cycle of perceived risk, fear, and demand for control has created a selfsustaining process similar in dynamics to the Will Rogers phenomenon” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 4)

Prevention never stops

> “Similar to other feedback cycles between aggregate perception, beliefs, and routines discussed above, the ‘‘do not delay’’ campaign was sustained by a cycle of fear, selling of control, behavior change, and the perception of efficacy.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 4)

> “To summarize briefly the campaign’s dynamics vis a vis breast cancer, women were implored to come to medical attention if they noticed any suspicious changes in their breasts. This educational message was designed and delivered in ways that appealed to and increased fears of cancer. At the same time in which this campaign took hold, pathologists and clinicians were defining new and earlier types of pre-cancers and were also lowering their threshold for diagnosing cancer. As more women sought medical attention as a result of the campaign, these changes in diagnostic practices interacted with the greater pool of women with breast problems seeking medical attention to result in an ever increasing number of breast cancer diagnoses.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 4)

This is a very cool example. It shows how supply creates demand - quite the contrary however to classic economic thinking

> “ince mortality from breast cancer was largely unchanged during the period of the ‘‘do not delay’’ campaign, these increasing numbers of diagnoses meant that the ratio of deaths to diagnosed cases was rapidly decreasing. From an epidemiological perspective, the case fatality rate associated with breast cancer declined and survival rates increased.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 4)

Hmm - but is this then a "real" effect

> “Many subjects reported that this was ‘‘very scary’’ or the ‘‘scariest time’’ of their lives. But it does not seem that the experience of false positives in any way derailed subjects’ enthusiasm for screening. Instead, some 98% of the subjects who experienced false positive results reported that they were very satisfied that they had been screened. The experience of a cancer diagnosis and its subsequent removal appeared to only strengthen already positive attitudes about cancer screening, providing a partial explanation for the autonomous and self-sustaining quality of some contemporary disease prevention interventions” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 5) 

Oke, so the fear or medicalisation is indeed very real.

> “These interactions among changing epidemiological perceptions, beliefs, and behavior have been sustained by a massive and rapid diffusion of screening technologies, with their embedded suppliers, managers, and interpreters. But these technological and manpower investments are only one part of a larger system in which economic interests have shaped new conceptions of health and disease.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 5)

Ok - so requirement for manpower is also the result of framing

> “While it evidently matters whether efficacy is framed in terms of individual relative risk or in terms of population impact, there has been little explicit societal debate or negotiation among the affected parties to how disease and health should be framed.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 5)

This is an excellent point - it does indeed matter whether disease should be framed in terms of individual or population impact. And this difference in emphasis has real effects.

> “social patterning of many conditions” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 6)

I gues this just means among whom the disease is distributed

> “The social patterning arises from the interaction between the changing mechanisms of consumption and new ways diseases and health problems are legitimated and defined.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 6)

> “Framing health disparities: consequences of or ways to maintain social inequalities?” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 6)  

Does this matter? I don't really think so..  
having read the article: yes it does.

> “But perhaps some of the racial and socio-economic disparity evident in obesity rates is functional, not only a direct consequence of inequalities in access to healthy foods and other determinants (that clearly are operative).” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 7)

> “By functional, I mean to call attention to social dynamics, especially important to explain how and why enthusiasm for the current medicalization of obesity has taken root and the class-tinged decisions made by individuals.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 7)

> “Like R dropping, higher average weight historically (in a time of more expensive calories) was more prevalent among the better off. It also took on some symbolic value as a marker of socio-economic progress and advancement. But as cheap calories became more widely available the poor also got fatter. What was once a marker of high socio-economic standing reversed its meaning and the social dynamic of differentiation meant that many who had the resources to reduce their weight or evade obesity did s” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 7)

> “In other words, as obesity became a marker for lower prestige and status, people with greater resources had more ability and motivation to avoid the stigma of obesity. The enthusiasm with which moderate obesity has been framed as a risk factor, disease, and public health threat has helped the better off to put additional distance between them and those less fortunate.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 7)

Interesting - here the technology (fast food possibilities) also provide to be useful. Would be interesting to think about whether framing effects *themselves* have a history.

> “But one would miss the dynamic that maintains and fuels the ‘‘disparity’’ if we thought of weight gain by different social groups as simply the result of material conditions in which groups lived or cultural difference.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 7)

This might be something to test in my research.

> “Lyme disease’s appearance and distribution” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 8)

It is by the way fascinating -- as in, inspiring -- to think of progress in quantitative terms and on a population level.

> “We might reflect more critically on the social and policy attention given to some health disparities. I have suggested that some disparities in highly visible intermediate health outcomes such as moderate obesity might have their own dynamic, independent of and in addition to the material determinants of incidence” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 8)

> “An example of a ‘‘positive’’ role for emphasizing framing as mechanism is discernable in the social patterning of hypertension in the United States today. Unlike the situation in many other health conditions and despite the evident inequalities in access to e and quality of e health care, African Americans with hypertension are more likely to be correctly diagnosed and treated than European Americans (there remain, nevertheless, significant and disturbing disparities in the underlying incidence of hypertension, due in part to differences in diet and activity and their multiple determinants, as well as in hypertension control; Hertz, Unger, Cornell, & Saunders, 2005). One possible explanation for the ‘‘positive’’ pattern is that earlier public health educational campaigns aimed at the African American community and physicians worked and became self-perpetuating as both medical and lay beliefs about who was at risk changed.” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 8)

Haha - positive still in between quotation marks. It also truly reminds me of discussions about positive discrimination.

> “Can we influence health by changing our diagnostic definitions and practice, health beliefs, and aggregate perceptions of disease?” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 9)

This is exactly what science does. In that sense the argument is rather trivial.

> “Knowledge of both framing and more materialist influences on the social patterning of health and disease are necessary if we are to wisely balance research and intervention investments between health and everything else, and within health between curative and preventive services, and population and individuallevel determinants” (Aronowitz, 2008, p. 9)

I btw think that spatiallity might also be an important determinant
