## Reading notes

The cross societies were founded because municipalities did not succeed in committing to its duties from the [[1872 Wet tot voorziening besmettelijke ziekten (epidemiewet)]]. 

One of the central questions of the book is to investigate how the tension between civil society and the governement influenced the development of muncipal health services.

Kerkhoff argues that [[Troughout the 20th century, the influence of local governments decreased while the influence of national governments increased.]]

Kerkhoff has a very attractive and pragmatic solution to deal with the variety of names under which municipal health services operated (p.13-15). He calls them intentionally "GGD" - for my research, it might be helpfull to call them "municipal health services".

[chapter 1]

The opening and emphasis on radical and social-democrat politics reminds of [[Mooij Israels - 2001 - Aan de Achtergracht; 100 jaar GGD in Amsterdam]].  But author seems to suggest that the actual foundation of the municipal health servies was highly unlikely, given that the [[1851 Gemeentewet]], [[1854 Armenwet]], [[1865 Wet regelende het Geneeskundig Staatstoezicht]] did not require that much from municipalities. This changed with [[1872 Wet tot voorziening besmettelijke ziekten (epidemiewet)]].

Only with the [[1901 Eerste Gezondheidswet]], when municipalities were required to install health committees (such as [[Utrechtse Gezondheidscommissie]] [[Rotterdamse Gezondheidscommissie]] and [[Amsterdamse Gezondheidscommissie]]), this started to change. Only the [[1912 gewijzigde Armenwet]], the national government really started to interfer. This is also what [[Bertens - 2021 - Liberal Solidarity]] claims. An example of the influence of the [[1912 gewijzigde Armenwet]] was the installment of armenzorg with the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Rotterdam]] in 1920.

According to Kerkhoff [[Big municipalities took the lead in developing municipal health care, and inspired smaller communities.]] (p. 22) Amsterdam had been the most important influence for most of the century, according to kerkhoff. More interesting, though, is that he argues that [[With respect to public health, National government cristalised what had already been the case in pioneering bigger municipalites.]] 

Then sums development in Amsterdam, the Hague and Utrecht.
- For Amsterdam, description follows [[Mooij Israels - 2001 - Aan de Achtergracht; 100 jaar GGD in Amsterdam]].
- For the Hague, it becomes clear that [[Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Den Haag]] was initiated as the result of inspection of municipal personnel. significant newcomer is [[1929 Besmettelijke ziektenwet]].
- Apparently, the organistion of the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Utrecht]] was nationally seen as something new. Founded in 1914, the service was organised in neighboorheids. It also included a [[vaccinatiebureau Utrecht]], which was founded in 1912.

Reasons for municipal motives:
- no real inspection for city-paid hospital admissions
- necessity for medical inspection of municipal workforce
- Demand for proper transportation of the sick

[chapter 2]

Kerkhoff begins with [[1920 (mislukte) wet op de instelling van gezondheidsdiensten]], stating that this resulted from the WW1 and malfunctioning gezondheidscommissies from the [[1901 Eerste Gezondheidswet]]. This really problematises [[Between 1848-1912, a Liberal governmentality for state and society is devised, and the rhetoric and reality of state absence in health care run parallel.]] as [[Bertens - 2021 - Liberal Solidarity]] states. However, it becomes clear that this might have been the case because this law regarded primarely preventice medicine on a population level.

Nevertheless, the most important reason for resistance and finally the withdrawel of the law was the success achieved by civil society, such as the cross associations. [[The succes of private initative in child health served as an argument against governemental interferance.]]  

Nevertheless, many municipalities themselves initiated health services themselves, as result of the [[1918 Spaanse griep]] and other infectious disease during WW1.

It is interesting that according to Kerkhoff, school physicians tried to keep their activities outside of municipal involvement, or involvement of health services. This could explain why the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] involved the school physicians at a relatively late stage. This can also be explained because only with the [[1922 Wet op lager onderwijs]], school phsycians were not a part of the ministry of education, but part of public health and labour.

[Chapter 3]

Interesting that a [[1939 Inentingswet]] was going in to effect as preparation to WW2. Also important: in 1942, the Germon occupator decided to stimulate Jeugdgezondheidszorg (see p.61). It meant that school physicians received more funding from the national governemnt. This happened at the same time that [[1941 Ziekenfondswet]] had the result that care for the poor was taken off the municipalities.

After the war, the [[1946 National conference for public health]] was organised, and was the [[Centrale Raad voor de Volksgezondheid]] founded. Nevertheless, it took a while before the [[1956 Gezondheidswet]] came into being, especially since different committees gave input: [[Commissie van Rhijn]] and [[Commissie Banning]]. The latter tried to strenghen the connection between civil society and government with government as responsible for optimal condition, and civil society for operations [[In the middle of the twentieth century, a strong balance between municipal and civil initiatives formed the core of public health.]] This was also the important point of the [[Commissie van Rhijn]]. There was also another report from the [[Katholieke Volkspartij (KVP)]] by [[J. Th. M. de Vreese]] and [[Chr. J. Mol]]. This report was both a product of and result of [[verzuiling]] on a national level.

Also very interesting conclusion! [[In the middle of the 20th century, the success of curative and clinical medicine made governments blind for the preventive potential of municipal health services.]] It might also be worthwile #todo, to investigate the preproposals of the [[1956 Gezondheidswet]].

Absolutely unrelated to my topic, but the history of population screening [[bevolkingsonderzoek]] and its relation with Phillips and r√∂ntgen apparaten, would be a great topic.

[chapter 4]

[[1974 Structuurnota]] is discussed as the starting point of [[echalonisering]],  [[Regionalisering]], and [[democratisering]] and a positive development for municipal health services. Especially with its implied criticism on curative care. It countered [[In the middle of the 20th century, the success of curative and clinical medicine made governments blind for the preventive potential of municipal health services.]]

[conclusions]
- [[The expansion pattern of municipal health services followed trends of urbanisation.]]
- [[The expansion pattern of municipal health services followed developments in Dutch  political culture.]]
- [[Troughout the 20th century, public health policy was the result of the interaction between civil society and the national government, the municipal government only stepped in during the 1970s. ]]
- [[With the development of the welfare state, the national government has downsized the autonomy of municipalities and expanded their executive duties.]]
