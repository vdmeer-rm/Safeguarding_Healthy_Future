## Reading notes

### 11 January 1978

Biopower:

> “By this I mean a number of phenomena that seem to me to be quite significant, namely, the set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became the object of a political strategy, of a general strategy of power, or, in other words, how starting from the eighteenth century, modern Western societies took on board the fundamental biological fact that human beings are specicies.(Foucault, 2009, p. 1)

Power as co-produced:

> “Mechanisms of power are an instrinsic part of all these relations and, in a circular way, are both their effect and cause.”(Foucault, 2009, p. 2)

Object of study:

> “I see its role as that of showing the knowledge effects produced by the struggles, confrontations, and battles that take place within our society, and by the tactics of power that are the elements of this struggle.” (Foucault, 2009, p. 3)

Foucault describes the concomitant forms of power:

-   law | object: territory
    
-   Discipline | object: body
    
-   Security | object: population

Foucault then writes about the excercise of power through these mechanism in the space of the town. Showing [[The space of the city is a good object of study for the excersice of power.]] Three examples:

Legal mechanism - the geographical localization of souvereignty in a capitcal:
> The town-capital is thought in terms of relations of sovereignty excercised over a territory. (Foucault, 2009, p. 15)

Disciplinary systeem:
> Disciplinary treatment of multiplicities in space, that is to say, the constitution of an empty, closed space within which artificial multiplicities are to be constructed and organized according to the triple principle of hierarchy, precise communication of relations of power, and functional effects specific to this distribution, for example, ensuring trade, housing, and so on. (Foucault, 2009, p. 17)

Surveillance:
> Symply a matter of maximizing the positive elements, for which one provides the ebst possible circulation, and of minimizing what is risky and inconvenient, like theft and disease, while knowing that they will never be competely suppressed. (Foucault, 2009, p. 19)

Especially his distinction betwwen surveillance and discipline is important. Security is thus about uncertainty given certain conditions.
> Discipline works in an empty, artificial space that is to be completely constructed. Security will rely on a number of material givens. (Foucault, 2009, p. 19)
> It is simply a matter of maximizing the positive elements, for which one provides the best possible circulation, and of minimizing what is risky and inconvenient, like theft and disease, while knowing that they will never be completely surpressed. One will therefore work not only on natural givens, but also on quantities that can be relatively, but never wholly reduced, and, since they can never be nullified, one works on probailites. (Foucault, 2009, p. 19).

Thus:
> The management of these series that, because they are open series can only be controlled by an estimate of probabilites, is pretty much the essential characteristic of the mechanism of security. (Foucault, 2009, p. 20)

I am interested whether [[There might be a development from mechanisms of discipline to mechanisms of security observable.]] What would be the relationship with [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]]?


### 18 January 1978

Foucault starts the lecture with an extensive explanation of the scarcity as an example of how solutions to this problem mobilise economic resoning, basically making the argument for natural selection as justification for certain types of political intervention. 

Then he elaborates on his famous distinction beteween the series of individuals and the population. I will quote the full passage here:

> Not a level of the collective and a level of the individual, for after all it is not just an individual who will die, or at any rate suffer, from this scarctiy. But we will have an absolutely fundamental ceasura between a level that is pertinent for the government's economic-poltical action, and this is the level of the population, and a different level which will be that of the series, the multiplicity of individuals, who will not be pertinent, or rather who will only be pertinent to the extent that, properly managed, maintained, and encouraged, it will make possible what one wants to obtain at the level that is pertinent. //
> The multiplicity of individuals is no longer pertinent, the population is. This ceasura within what constituted the totality of the subjects or inhabitants of a kingdom is not a real ceasure. There is not a real distinction between some and others. But within the system of knowledge-power, within the economic technology and management there is this break between the pertinent level of the population and the level that is not pertinent, or that is simply instrumental. //
> The final objective is the population. The population is perinent as the objective, and indivuals, the series of individuals, are no longer pertinent as the objective, but simply as the instrument, relay, or condition for obtaining something at the level of the population. (Fouault, 2009, p. 42)

This makes me wonder that [[There might be a shift in a focus on individual bodies, to a population.]]
