[Preface]

Amsterdam has the oldest and biggist Municipal health service. According to Israels and Mooij [[That  public health problems arrived first and were the most horrible in Amsterdam explains why the municipality seems to have such a pioneering place in the history of public health.]]

[Chapter 1]

Quite interesting that the authors argue that [[Many of the second wave of hygiensts found shelter at municipal health services and as professors.]]

After universal suffrage, the political dynamics changed, with the result that the [[radicalen]]  became more powerful. This resulted in more governmental interferance on a municipal level.

The [[Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] was founded by [[Rudolf Saltet]] in 1893, was appointed as director in 1891 without personnel. First municipal health service in the Netherlands, wand first with a laboratory (in the world). Authors explain foundation as resulting from Cholera epidemic in 1892.

New director was [[H.G. Ringeling]] Three tasks
- food inspection
- infectious diseases excecution of [[1872 Wet tot voorziening besmettelijke ziekten (epidemiewet)]] Quite some agressive surveillance (see. p. 33 of [[Mooij Israels - 2001 - Aan de Achtergracht; 100 jaar GGD in Amsterdam]]) Inspection of schoolgoing children, also execution of [[1872 Wet tot voorziening besmettelijke ziekten (epidemiewet)]]. In 1916, the health service got its own quarantaine location [[quarantaine-inrichting Zeeburg]] at the Zeeburgerdijk.
- Inspection of homes in 1896

Interesting how authors come up with reasons for the improvement of population health in the late 19th Century, apart from that medio-therapeutic developments did not really contribute:
- medicalisation of society, resulting in a more hygienic mindset
- [[Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]]
- better housing and incomes.

[chapter 2]

[[C.V. Gerritsen]] founded the [[Amsterdamsche Geneeskundige Dienst]]. Founded on the initiative of [[C.V. Gerritsen]], resulting from a dispute over whether physicians executing poor relief care should be part of the municipal health service. Before, physicians were paid to care for those who could not afford it, quite some doubts arose on the efficacy of the earlier arrangements. A committee (including [[Hector Treub]]) was installed to inspect the problematic situation. They proposed, among inspection of patients, the introduction of municipal [[wijkverpleegkundigen]].  The introduction of municipal physicians was a point of tension. [[Competition within the medical profession played an important driver for organisational change.]] Municipal council members investigated the system of municipal health care for the poor, and concluded:
- The system of paying young inexperienced doctors to free have office hours did not work
- District nursing should stay
- The city should be diveded into districts with a matching governance
- Experienced doctors were hired assisted by inexperienced ones (the Groningen model)

After again a lot of discussions in the municipal council, it was decided to raise salaris of municipal physicians. According to [[Mooij Israels - 2001 - Aan de Achtergracht; 100 jaar GGD in Amsterdam]], this was a big set-back for normal physicians, who were afraid for inflation of the medicial status. [[Louis Heijermans]], later director of the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]].

[chapter 3]

The [[Amsterdamsche Geneeskundige Dienst]] offcially started in 1903  with [[Menno Huizinga]] as director. [[Johanna van Maarseveen]] was one of the first municipal physicans. First started with the ambulance service and first aid.

In 1903, [[H.B.L. Vos]] started the first [[Consultatiebureau]] with approval of [[Menno Huizinga]]. He had office hours twice a week. Emphasis on [[borstvoeding]] and nutrition, also because lack of [[borstvoeding]] was indicated as most important cause for child mortality. #todo a study from the municipality itself investigated child mortality based on visits (only the poor were welcome), this study looked at difference in different neighbourhoods. In 1905 also [[Johanna van Maarseveen]] started office hours for children. When the power of the Amsterdam social-democrats increased, infant care expanded to the whole population (not only the poor). In 1909, young parents received *wenken voor moeders* with birth registration, based on the activities of [[Gemeentebestuur Rotterdam]]. In 1910, civil societies started infant care as the [[Amsterdamsche Vereeniging voor de Zuigelingenzorg]] opened two consultation offices, and the [[Katholieke Vereniging voor de Zuigelingenzorg Amsterdam]] in 1919. Until 1920, when infant care was taken over by the [[Amsterdamsche Geneeskundige Dienst]] as a whole. [[The Amsterdam municipality was unique in organising infant care without civil society from 1920. ]]

According to [[Mooij Israels - 2001 - Aan de Achtergracht; 100 jaar GGD in Amsterdam]], [[the incentive to organise school physicians came from German cities who successfully organised medical examination in the context of schools.]] Although the [[Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] inspected schools, children were not inspected. School physicians were hired in 1910 by the [[Amsterdamsche Geneeskundige Dienst]]. Also here, [[Competition within the medical profession played an important driver for organisational change.]] 

[Chapter 4]

Authors describe the importance of the shifting political climate from liberal-radical to social-democrat. Lot of intervention on living and food. Social-democrats and the expansion of the [[Amsterdamsche Geneeskundige Dienst]] went hand in hand:

> De Geneeskundige dienst heeft in de jaren twintig optimaal geprofiteerd vanhet bestuurlijke klimaat en is in deze jaren uitgegroeid tot een succesful instrumnet van de sociaal-democratische gemeentepolitiek (p.94)

The most important example is [[Louis Heijermans]], who became director of the [[Amsterdamsche Geneeskundige Dienst]] in 1919. Explosive growth of employees (from 200 to 500). Interesting is the foundation of a [[medisch-statisch bureau Amsterdam]] of which [[C.J. Brenkman]] became director. Heijermans also expanded school medicine.

[[The annexation of infant care by the Amsterdam municipality should be understood as an example of the expansion of the municipal health service under Louis Heijermans.]] Additionally,[[The annexation of infant care by the Amsterdam municipality was the result of the desire to expand infant care to more than only poor families]] Most important remained [[zoogpropaganda]] and refering to other institutions.

Centralising seemed to materialise in the new [[Centraal gebouw aan de achtergracht]] in 1924. It seems to be a prequel of what happened in Rotterdam [[In the 1930s, public health initiatives were centralised by building the 'De Baan'.]]

In 1923, the [[Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] and [[Amsterdamsche Geneeskundige Dienst]] merged as [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]]. Resulting from the expansion under [[Louis Heijermans]]. This had the result that in general, public health became more preventive, rather than a form of poor relief. [[In the early twentieth century, public health became a form of preventive collective health rather than poor relief.]] [[Amsterdam municipal health under Heijermans care became model for other municipalities. ]]

Authors describe the interesting dynamic resulting from the division between the [[ziekenfonds Amsterdam]] and the existence of health care for the poor. Resulting from the improvement of care for the poor, the costs rose. This lead to a debate on whether care for poor should be taken out of the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] and taken over (and controlled) by the [[ziekenfonds Amsterdam]].

In 1933, the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] started with [[kleuterzorg]]. A deep desired from [[Louis Heijermans]], who published quite a lot on the issue that children remained out of sight between infant care and school physicians. Nevertheless, the period of the 1930s were known by budget cuts. [[Arie Quirido]] was in charge of organising the budget cuts.

[chapter 5]

[[The history of the Amterdam GGD can be devided in half a century in which care centered around helping the poor, and half a century in which the GGD functioned around a collection of several activities.]] This was practically the result of the [[1941 Ziekenfondswet]] that had the result that health care for the was not asked for at the municipality but at the ziekenfonds. Became official in 1951 in Amsterdam. This law did not have that much influence on cities, becaue Ziekenfondsen already existed. After the war [[Simon Spijer]] became adjunst director of the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]].

It is interesting how the authors of [[Mooij Israels - 2001 - Aan de Achtergracht; 100 jaar GGD in Amsterdam]] claim that before the war, folks such as [[Louis Heijermans]], [[Ben Sajet]], and [[Arie Quirido]] as well as the expanasion of the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] could flourish in a cultural context of social-democrat and radical-liberal activities. This sentiment was over after the second world war, according to the authors (p. 139). An intersting claim, because reform on the side of cross societies started in in the period after the war.

Interesting that on the initiative of [[Ben Sajet]], [[Arie Quirido]] became the new director of public health and hospital care. On his initiative, the [[Centraal bureau Openbare Gezondheid]] was founded in 1953, resulting from [[medisch-statisch bureau Amsterdam]].

[Chapter 6]

The organisation lost it elan in the years after WW2. It was - according to the authors - a completely different kind of organisation. The consequense of losing the care for the poor had, as it was perceived, caused a shift of focussing on curatieve rather than preventive care. The [[A transition can be observed from a focus on infectious disease and nutrition before WW2 to a focus on physical, mental, and social wellbeing after WW2.]] [[The transition from infectious disease to chronic disease seems to co-exist the shift of focus from children to the elderly.]] This also had the consequence that [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] started worrying about elderly people.

The 1950s were charactisered by vaccination campaigns by the [[Afdeling Jeugdgezondheidszorg GGD Amsterdam]]. [[Developments on infant care in Amsterdam in teh 1950s were mainly visible in the expanding vaccination campaigns.]]:
- 1952 [[Diphteria]]
- 1953 [[Whooping Cough]]
- 1956 [[Tetanus]]
- 1957 [[Polio]]

In general, the transition from curative to preventive care in this relatively calm period was not complete, especially because certain new departments (mental care, geriatrics, etc.) expanded. However, in discourse about the future of the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]] can clearly observed that [[Between 1968 and 1987, the social ideology of access to health care is taken up by the state, but a new governmentality of state 'planning' in health care fails.]] Not a lot happenend, and especially two developments were clearly visible:
1. The youth culture of the 60s and its resulting drug culture
2. The increasing multicultural city with new cultural norms and health problems.

What is interesting, however, is that the authors of [[Mooij Israels - 2001 - Aan de Achtergracht; 100 jaar GGD in Amsterdam]] suggest that [[National governmental absense and leaving collective action to municipalities was the result of good socioeconomic conditions.]] Thius means that the rise of [[New Public Management]] is indeed the result of stagnating economic progress, and a solution to economic problems (which I think that it is).

[Chapter 7]

The 1980s were known by the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Rotterdam]] as a period of budget cuts and reorganisation. One of the biggest influences was the [[1989 wet collectieve preventie Volksgezondheid]]. [[The 'Wet Collectieve Preventie Volksgezond' made the funding of municipal health services part of the municipal budget, resulting in competion with other municipal services.]] 

[[In the 1980s, the Amsterdam GGD started focussing on spatial and socioeconomic distribution of health problems.]]

Beyond scope of this project, but the role the Amsterdam GGD played in handling AIDS is remarkable.

To manage the shrinking budget, [[Afdeling Jeugdgezondheidszorg GGD Amsterdam]] tried to manage its activities under the banner of [[efficiency]], following [[In the 1960s, efficient organisation became a goal in an on itself.]].

> In 1975 werd in het jaarverslag van de GG&GD over de afdeling Jeugdgezondheidszorg - de afdeling van de consultatiebureaus en de schoolartsen - al geschreven dat het jaar in het teken had gestaan van 'reorganisatie, beheersbaarheid, capaciteitsgebruik en efficiency.' (p. 187)

In 1982, [[Henk Rengelink]] became director of the [[Gemeentelijke Geneeskundige en Gezondheidsdienst Amsterdam]]. [[The period under director Rengelink was known by budget cuts, contraction and reorganisation. Preventive child health intervention became smaller.]]

In 1986, Alderman [[Ada Wildekamp]] tried to cut the budget of [[Afdeling Jeugdgezondheidszorg GGD Amsterdam]] under the direction of [[C.P.J. le Nobel]]. The cuts were specifically directed at school physicians. The discussion escalated in *Het Parool*.

[[Between 1992 and 1995, the Amsterdam GGD was subject to discussions and plans to become independent ]] Fits [[Between 1987-2015, the introduction of the ‘health care market’ goes back to an old governmentality, but the state’s role in providing access to health care grows larger than ever]] This changes with the new Alderman [[Jikkie van der Giessen]] and new interim director [[G.P.J. Schouten]]. They combined [[Afdeling Jeugdgezondheidszorg GGD Amsterdam]] with the department of mental health in 1997.

[tot besluit]

[[The Amsterdam GGD suffered in the second half of the 20th century with problems of legitimacy.]]
